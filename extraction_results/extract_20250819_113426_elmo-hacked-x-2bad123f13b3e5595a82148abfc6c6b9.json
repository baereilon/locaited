Workshop](https://apnews.com/article/sesame-street-elevate-prize-foundation-catalyst-award-523180a38f00982924dcc57035fab383) regained control of its Elmo account on the X platform Monday after a hacker gained access and posted a string of racist and antisemitic messages.\n\n\u201cElmo\u2019s X account was compromised by an unknown hacker who posted disgusting messages, including antisemitic and racist posts,\u201d Sesame Workshop, the nonprofit [behind \u201cSesame Street\u201d](https://apnews.com/article/sesame-street-netflix-move-pbs-b74920f423e9790973b59735689696c2) and Elmo, said in a statement Monday.\n\nThe account was compromised over the weekend and instead of the usual posts of encouragement and kindness, Elmo\u2019s 650,000 followers were given antisemitic threats and a profane reference to the [Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking investigation](https://apnews.com/article/jeffrey-epstein-justice-department-pam-bondi-03fbcd024f631440f7ed62b3c6927db3). Those tweets were soon deleted.\n\nX did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nElmo\u2019s social media account has lately become a place for mental health awareness. Last year, the red fuzzy monster, eternally 3 \u00bd, [caused a sensation](https://apnews.com/article/pop-culture-2024-c985d4b171608dcc00bf07c3989512d3) when he asked: \u201cElmo is just checking in! How is everybody doing?\u201d It prompted responses from then-President Joe Biden and Chance the Rapper.\n\nPowered By\n\n98.8K\n\n0\n\n![Image
