It\u2019s not clear that the events were connected.\n\nHer exit also comes months after Musk [sold X](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/28/business/elon-musk-sells-x-to-xai), his social media company, to xAI, his artificial intelligence company. The move formally combined the two entities that were already closely intertwined, but raised questions about Yaccarino\u2019s role in the new company going forward.\n\nAd Feedback\n\nAd Feedback\n\nYaccarino announced her exit in a [post](https://x.com/lindayax/status/1942957094811951197?s=46) on the platform, saying she is \u201cimmensely grateful\u201d to Musk for \u201centrusting me with the responsibility of protecting free speech, turning the company around, and transforming X into the Everything App.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, the best is yet to come as X enters a new chapter with @xai,\u201d she said in the post. \u201cI\u2019ll be cheering you all on as you continue to change the world.\u201d\n\nMusk replied to Yaccarino\u2019s post with a [terse response](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1942967206993961124): \u201cThank you for your contributions.\u201d\n\nOne current X employee, who requested anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to speak publicly, said Yaccarino\u2019s exit wasn\u2019t entirely surprising, in light of the ongoing challenges the company has faced convincing advertisers to return to the platform \u2013 something the longtime marketing executive was brought in to do.\n\nIn November 2023, Musk publicly [lashed out at advertisers](https://www.cnn.com/videos/media/2023/11/30/elon-musk-x-advertisers-boycott-platform-antisemitism-ebof-vpx.cnn) leaving the platform, telling them to \u201cgo f**k yourself.\u201d The fallout from that outburst with brands has been \u201congoing,\u201d the employee said, and escalated with Musk\u2019s involvement in President Donald Trump\u2019s administration.\n\nX\u2019s combination with xAI also raised questions about the company\u2019s priorities, with Musk more focused on product improvements than business operations, they said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lack of clarity, internally and externally as well, of what X is supposed to be,\u201d the employee said, adding that working with the company\u2019s partners is more difficult \u201cif you can\u2019t articulate what our plan is for the next three years.\u201d\n\nAs of Wednesday night, Musk had not made any staff-wide comments to X employees about Yaccarino\u2019s departure, the employee said.\n\nA rocky tenure\n--------------\n\nYaccarino, a former NBCUniversal marketing executive, [took over](https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/05/tech/linda-yaccarino-twitter-ceo-elon-musk) from Musk as CEO of X \u2014 at the time, it was called Twitter \u2014 in June of 2023, about eight months after the billionaire bought the social media platform. She was brought on to help fix the platform\u2019s flagging advertising business, after Musk [alienated brands](https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/04/tech/twitter-advertisers) with his controversial comments and changes to the platform.\n\nBut her tenure has been marked by repeated public relations crises, including scrutiny over antisemitic and other hateful content spreading on the platform, viral [false claims around international conflicts](https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/09/tech/musk-x-misinformation-israel-hamas-conflict) and ads that appeared alongside pro-Nazi content on the site. That led some [brands to pull their spending](https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/17/tech/lionsgate-suspends-advertising-x-musk/index.html), for [which the Yaccarino-led X sued an advertising industry group](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/06/tech/musk-x-sues-garm-advertising-boycott) \u2014 a lawsuit Yaccarino announced in a video message to all X users, in which she decried what she referred to as a conspiracy to boycott the X platform. (The industry group, Global Alliance for Responsible Media, [shut down](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/09/tech/elon-musk-garm-advertisers-lawsuit) days after the lawsuit was filed.)\n\nIn the years since Musk took over X, the company has also had to contend with a rush of new competitors, including Bluesky and Meta\u2019s Threads.\n\nYaccarino repeatedly touted the company\u2019s \u201cfreedom of speech, not freedom of reach\u201d policy that aims to limit the reach of so-called lawful but awful content on the platform. Under her leadership, X also said it had rolled out additional brand safety controls for advertisers, including the ability to avoid having their ads show next to \u201ctargeted hate speech, sexual content, gratuitous gore, excessive profanity, obscenity, spam, drugs.\u201d\n\nBut the company\u2019s challenges escalated after X integrated xAI\u2019s Grok chatbot into the platform, where users can ask the AI questions and bring it into conversation threads with other users. In May, Grok [erroneously brought up](https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/14/business/grok-ai-chatbot-replies) a theory of \u201cwhite genocide\u201d in South Africa in response to unrelated questions. And on Tuesday \u2014 weeks after Musk said he would rebuild the chatbot because he was unsatisfied with some of its replies that he viewed as too politically correct \u2014 the chatbot shared antisemitic tropes. In response, xAI said it removed some posts and \u201chas taken action to ban hate speech before Grok posts on X.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear whether Yaccarino, as head of the social media business, had any control over Grok or the company\u2019s other AI operations.\n\nWorking alongside Musk\n----------------------\n\nDuring her time as CEO of X, Yaccarino also faced questions about her power and influence over the company compared to Musk. The billionaire has said he is the company\u2019s chief technology officer, leading product and technology teams, but his controversial statements and seemingly off-the-cuff policy pronouncements often seemed to leave Yaccarino on the back foot.\n\n\u201cBeing the CEO of X was always going to be a tough job, and Yaccarino lasted in the role longer than many expected,\u201d Jasmine Enberg, vice president at research firm Emarketer, said in emailed commentary. \u201cFaced with a mercurial owner who never fully stepped away from the helm and continued to use the platform as his personal megaphone, Yaccarino had to try to run the business while also regularly putting out fires.\u201d\n\nAnne Marie Malecha, CEO of reputation and crisis management firm Dezenhall Resources, added that Musk is \u201cone of those people that is willing to do whatever works for him during that day,\u201d which could have put Yaccarino in a \u201cvery difficult position.\u201d\n\nAnd while X announced on-platform video podcasts with high-profile figures like Khloe Kardashian and several new finance tools, including a [partnership with Visa](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/28/elon-musk-x-visa-digital-wallet.html) to provide peer-to-peer payments, those features are niche offerings and the platform has not exactly become the \u201ceverything app\u201d Yaccarino said she wanted to create.\n\nUse of the platform has also fallen during her tenure, from 915.9 million combined active app users and unique website visitors during the month she took over to just 684.2 million last month, according to web traffic analysis firm Similarweb.\n\nYaccarino\u2019s exit comes at a complicated time for Musk\u2019s businesses, [especially Tesla](https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/08/business/tesla-troubled-financial-outlook), and his political involvement has raised questions about his ability and commitment to lead multiple companies. Her departure comes shortly after several high level exits at Tesla, including Omead Afshar, Tesla\u2019s head of manufacturing and operations.\n\nMusk has also recently engaged in a [high-profile feud](https://www.cnn.com/business/timeline-elon-musk-trump-x-dg) with President Donald Trump, whom he\u2019d previously supported, that has created a rift between Musk-world and Trump-world and prompted threats from the White House against the billionaire\u2019s companies.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone believed (Yaccarino) would make it this long,\u201d said Malecha. \u201cI also don\u2019t think that anyone anticipated that Musk would become part of the political zeitgeist in the way that he did during that two-year period.\u201d\n\nMalecha added that Yaccarino\u2019s exit could have been negotiated as part of X\u2019s merger with xAI, \u201cand, frankly, if I\u2019m her, I wouldn\u2019t be upset at my exit right now, based on what I\u2019m seeing out of this AI.\u201d\n\n_This story has been updated with additional details and context._\n\n_CNN\u2019s Hadas Gold contributed to this report._\n\ninfo\n\n The top numbered articles will be viewable to readers when programmed onto a page.
