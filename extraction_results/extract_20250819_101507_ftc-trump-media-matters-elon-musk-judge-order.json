Sooknanan cited evidence that the investigation, which was [opened by the Federal Trade Commission last spring](https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/22/media/ftc-media-matters-ad-groups-elon-musk-retribution), was an act of retaliation against the advocacy group, Media Matters for America.\n\nThe judge granted a preliminary injunction because, she wrote, \u201cMedia Matters is likely to succeed in its First Amendment retaliation claim, which is all it needs at this stage.\u201d\n\nAd Feedback\n\nMedia Matters has been a thorn in the side of Musk and his X social network for years. The group has published numerous reports about the prevalence of violent and hateful posts on X, leading Musk to call them an \u201cevil propaganda machine\u201d hellbent on harming his business by turning off advertisers.\n\nMusk [sued Media Matters in response](https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/13/tech/elon-musk-x-lawsuit-media-matters); the group has countersued, and some Republican elected officials have backed Musk. The overarching charge is that liberal activists have colluded with advertisers to hurt conservative platforms and chill speech.\n\nSome of the advertisers Musk has sued have fought back, arguing that he has resorted to legal and political maneuvers \u201cto win back the business X lost in the free market when it disrupted its own business and alienated many of its customers.\u201d\n\nWith President Trump back in power, Musk and other Media Matters opponents have felt emboldened. Media Matters alleged \u201cretribution\u201d when the FTC said it was probing possible collusion.\n\nMedia Matters filed suit against the FTC seeking legal relief, which is what Sooknanan delivered on Friday, though the court battle is likely to continue.\n\nAn FTC spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the court order.\n\nMedia Matters, which has been seriously hampered by Musk and company, said the injunction is a symbol of effective resistance to the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cThe court\u2019s ruling demonstrates the importance of fighting over folding, which far too many are doing when confronted with intimidation from the Trump administration,\u201d Media Matters president Angelo Carusone said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThis case is not just about the campaign to punish and silence Media Matters, however,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a critical test for whether the courts will allow any administration \u2014 from any political party \u2014 to bully media and non-profit organizations through illegal abuses of power.\u201d\n\n[See all topics](/follow)\n\n[Email](mailto:?subject=CNN%20content%20share&body=Check%20out%20this%20article%3A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2025%2F08%2F16%2Fmedia%2Fftc-trump-media-matters-elon-musk-judge-order \"Share with email\")\n\nLink Copied!\n\nAd Feedback\n\ninfo\n\nThe top numbered articles will be viewable to readers when programmed onto a page.
