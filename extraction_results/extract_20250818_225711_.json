Tuesday after complaints from X users and the Anti-Defamation League that Grok produced content with antisemitic tropes and praise for Adolf Hitler.\n\nIssues of political biases, hate speech and accuracy of AI chatbots have been a concern since at least the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in 2022.\n\nLearn about the latest breakthroughs in AI and tech with the Reuters Artificial Intelligencer

Extremist content has increased, causing advertisers to pull away from the platform.\n\nOn Tuesday, posts on Grok\u2019s X account suggested Hitler would be best-placed to combat anti-white hatred, saying he would \"spot the pattern and handle it decisively.\" The posts also referred to Hitler positively as \"history's mustache man,\" and commented that people with Jewish surnames were responsible for extreme anti-white activism.\n\nAdvertisement \u00b7 Scroll to continue\n\nxAI and Grok logos are seen in this illustration taken, February 16, 2025.

This supercharging of extremist rhetoric will only amplify and encourage the antisemitism that is already surging on X and many other platforms,\" ADL said on X.\n\nIn May, after users noticed Grok brought up the topic of \"white genocide\" in South Africa in unrelated discussions about other matters, xAI attributed it to an [unauthorized change that was made to Grok's response software](https://www.reuters.com/business/musks-xai-updates-grok-chatbot-after-white-genocide-comments-2025-05-17/).\n\nMusk last month promised an upgrade to the company's model, suggesting there was, \"far too much garbage in any foundation model trained on uncorrected data.\"\n\nDuring the latest controversy, posts on Grok\u2019s X account said the model made a \"slip-up\" by engaging with comments posted by a fake account with a common Jewish surname, and later that the fake account was a \"troll hoax to fuel division.\"\n\nCNN reported on Tuesday that when it asked Grok in a chat about its responses, Grok cited online message board 4chan as one of its sources. 4chan is a forum that [eschews moderation](https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/notorious-internet-messageboard-4chan-has-been-hacked-posts-claim-2025-04-15/), and has long been known for extremist and racist content.\n\nOn Wednesday, X CEO Linda Yaccarino [stepped down](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/x-ceo-yaccarino-step-down-surprise-move-2025-07-09/) from the company, though there was no known connection between her decision and the content posted by Grok.\n\nReporting by Daniel Trotta in Carlsbad, California; Editing by Saad Sayeed and Daniel Wallis\n\nOur
