It\u2019s a place for long speeches, private country-to-country whisper sessions, and group meetings on everything from regulating artificial intelligence to global conflicts.\n\nThis year features a UN once again caught in a debate over its relevancy while attempting to stem wars in [Gaza](https://www.cnn.com/profiles/christian-edwards), Ukraine and Sudan. All of which its Secretary General Antonio Guterres is keen to remedy.\n\nAd Feedback\n\nAd Feedback\n\n\u201cI have one overriding message today; an appeal to member states for a spirit of compromise,\u201d Guterres implored on Wednesday.\n\nIt is a refrain he and his predecessors have been saying for years. The UN\u2019s 193 member states can\u2019t decide on what to order for lunch, let alone find consensus on how to deal with the Israel\u2019s ongoing siege of Gaza, a major issue in Security Council meetings since the war began last October with militant group Hamas\u2019 terror attacks in Israel.\n\nThe Security Council, the UN\u2019s most powerful organ, has been dominated by just five veto-wielding countries (the United States, China, Russia, France, and the United Kingdom) since its inception and has increasingly found itself at a stalemate.\n\n[![Image 3: A security council meeting at United Nations (UN) headquarters in New York, US, on Wednesday, Aug. 28, 2024.

I think it is harsher,\u201d the diplomat added.\n\nSniping in the open council sessions often feature sharp-tongued exchanges between the big powers. Slovenia\u2019s UN envoy Samuel \u017dbogar, who is also the current president of the Security Council,described the atmosphere of council meetings as \u201cpoisonous.\u201d\n\nThe Council meets Friday to speak about exploding communications devices [in Lebanon](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/lebanon-explosions-hezbollah-israel-09-20-24-intl-hnk/index.html). That\u2019s a new one amid hundreds of angry meetings on Gaza, Ukraine and the rest.\n\n![Image 4: Ukrainian rescuers work to extinguish a fire in a residential building following a missile attack in Kharkiv on September 15, 2024, amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine.](https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2171371595.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill)\n\nUkrainian rescuers work to extinguish a fire in a residential building following a missile attack in Kharkiv on September 15, 2024, amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nSergey Bobok/AFP/Getty Images\n\nTaking the world stage\n----------------------\n\nStill, diplomats are optimistic about the possibility of change.US Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield said this week: \u201cit\u2019s easy to fall into cynicism, to actually give up hope and to give up on democracy, but we can\u2019t afford to do that.\u201d\n\nShe is leading a US effort to expand the Security Council with two seats for Africa. However, new members would not have the crucial veto power that the the post WW2 five wield.\n\nThe veto allows permanent members, known as the P5, to block any resolution, ranging from peacekeeping missions to sanctions, in defense of their national interests and foreign policy decisions.\n\nThe council also has 10 non-permanent members elected to two-year terms \u2013 but some feel toothless without veto privileges.\n\n\u201cI am critical of the permanent members because they have a bigger responsibility than the elected (10) members,\u201d Slovenia\u2019s \u017dbogar said.\n\nWhat the New York headquarters of the UN will provide next week is a forum for the Palestinians, Israelis, Ukrainians, Russians and others to speak their minds to the world and directly to each other.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is due to give a speech next Wednesday and appear at a special Security Council meeting.\n\n![Image 5: Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu addresses the 78th United Nations General Assembly at U.N. headquarters in New York City in 2023.](https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2023-09-22t132604z-1511389666-rc2pd3ahcsr8-rtrmadp-3-un-assembly.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill)\n\nPrime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu addresses the 78th United Nations General Assembly at U.N. headquarters in New York City in 2023.\n\nMike Segar/Reuters\n\nIsrael Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u2013 a former ambassador to the UN \u2013 may also be in attendance, speaking to the General Assembly later next week,which is expected to lead to a lot of walkouts from the assembly hall.\n\nAccording to Richard Gowan, UN director at the International Crisis Group, Netanyahu \u201chates the organization and he has a deep mistrust of it.\u201d\n\nNew British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is expected to make his first showing at the General Assembly after his predecessor, Rishi Sunak, skipped last year\u2019s meeting.\n\nAnd once again the leaders of China and Russia will skip it all, sending high-ranking ministers to speak in their stead.\n\nClimate, conflict, hunger and US politics\n-----------------------------------------\n\nThe amount of hot air from the speeches could turn the UN into one of the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases next week.\n\nClimate change will be one of the biggest issues being discussed, with the General Assembly expected to [hold a meeting](https://press.un.org/en/2024/ga11258.doc.htm)on sea level rise on Wednesday. Look out for leaders from vulnerable island nations push for more action to tackle global warming.\n\nThe war in Sudan will also be a talking point, where famine was declared in a refugee [camp near El Fasher](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/02/africa/sudan-darfur-famine-declared-civil-war-intl/index.html), the capital of Sudan\u2019s North Darfur state. The city has for months been besieged by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a rebel group that took up arms against the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) in April 2023.\n\nMillions have been forcibly displaced in the conflict and 25.6 million people in the country are facing acute hunger, [according to UN agencies](https://unric.org/en/unhcr-unicef-wfp-joint-press-briefing-on-sudan/)\n\n[![Image 6: The final result of a vote during the emergency session on the legal consequences of Israel's actions in the Palestinian territories is shown at United Nations Headquarters on September 18, 2024 in New York.

The non-binding text, which Israel says will fuel violence if adopted, is based on an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice calling Israel's occupation since 1967 \"unlawful.\" (Photo by Bryan Smith / AFP) Bryan Smith/AFP/Getty Images Related article UN members vote to demand Israel end occupation of Palestinian territories within 12 months](https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/18/middleeast/un-israel-end-occupation-palestine-intl)\n\nThe US presidential race also looms. A lot of diplomats are already concerned about who will be speaking for the US next year.\n\n\u201cI think in a lot of the private conversations around the General Assembly, the number one question will be: \u201cwhat will [Republican presidential nominee Donald] Trump do to the organization?\u201d Gowan said.\n\nIf the former US president is re-elected, the fallout for the UN won\u2019t be pretty, he said,predicting some heavy budget slashing. The US and China are by far the biggest funders to the UN.\n\nIf you felt six days of speeches could glaze the eyeballs, there is another big summit right before UNGA.\n\nDo not feel like you have to read on here, but it\u2019s a meeting called the\u201cSummit of the Future,\u201d and naturally countries are still negotiating its final summit document, called the \u201cPact for the Future,\u201d after months of talks.\n\nThe pact, now in its fourth revision, aims to provide a blueprint on how to tackle critical issues like conflicts, climate change, security council reform and the regulation of artificial intelligence.\n\nThe UN Secretary-General thinks the final document has the most significant reform in a generation. Another diplomat said \u201cit should make the UN more relevant.\u201dBut getting 193 of anything to agree on anything is difficult; so is the task for the 193 members of the UN General Assembly.\n\nJust think we almost made it through an UNGA story before a mention of New York traffic delays during UNGA. Watch out for those motorcades!\n\ninfo\n\n The top numbered articles will be viewable to readers when programmed onto a page.
