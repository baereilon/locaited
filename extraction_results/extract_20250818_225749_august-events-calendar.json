A new exhibit at The New York Historical showcases the culinary excellence served aboard airplanes, trains and ocean liners in the first half of the 20th century.\n\nTitled \"Dining in Transit,\" the exhibit explores how travel dining evolved\u2014from hiring French chefs to crafting signature dishes to unveiling the deeper stories of race and gender that shaped the industry. It also features some fascinating\u00a0artifacts, such as souvenir menus, promotional recipe books, employee handbooks, collectible tableware and a stewardess hat.\n\nOne souvenir menu from United Airlines dated for Valentine's Day in 1942 is adorned with red ribbon drawings and tiny hearts. The meal included hearts of lettuce salad, a roast larded tenderloin of beef, and \"Cupid's Ice Cream.\"\n\n**Time Out tip:** For a fun and historic treat, stop by the museum's\u00a0new restaurant,\u00a0[Clara](https://www.nyhistory.org/dine), for a special dessert menu inspired by the exhibit.
