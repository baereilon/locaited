The other two don\u2019t make sound at all, even though they\u2019re capable of doing so. That's exactly the point. Instead, their\u00a0potential for sound and the tension between dormancy and activation is where they hold power.\u00a0Go see these cool sculptures on the Met\u2019s gorgeous rooftop through October 19.\n\nThis will be the last roof garden commission for at least five years as the museum will soon embark on construction of its\u00a0[new modern and contemporary art annex](https://www.timeout.com/newyork/news/the-metropolitan-museum-of-art-just-revealed-renderings-of-its-forthcoming-500-million-modern-wing-121024), the Oscar L.

So it\u2019s only fitting that\u00a0*The New Yorker*\u00a0magazine would cover transit in exactly the same way. Since the magazine began a century ago, it has featured cartoons that both rib and extol public transportation.\n\nA new exhibit, \u201c[Commentary on The Commute: A Century of\u00a0*The New Yorker*'s Transportation Cartoons](https://www.nytransitmuseum.org/exhibits-collections/exhibits/),\" explores how the magazine\u2019s famed comical drawings have explored this subject over the past 100 years.

Into the streets!\" An exhibit at The Hispanic Society Museum & Library borrows that refrain for its title as it brings together 18 photographs by Francisco Alvarado-Ju\u00e1rez that highlight\u00a0the chaotic and colorful vitality of this first iteration of Pride.\n\nThe photographs of\u00a0the 1975 and 1976 marches showcase the racial and ethnic diversity of the\u00a0movement\u00a0and reveal the nuanced bonds of kinship formed among marchers from disparate backgrounds. In\u00a0these early days, Pride was a local\u00a0effort in New York City known as the Christopher Street Liberation Day March or the Gay Liberation Parade. Held as a direct response to the Stonewall Uprising of 1969, the\u00a0events\u00a0were a call for increased queer visibility at a time when New York still enforced so-called \"sodomy\" laws that facilitated the repression of the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nSee the exhibition at the Hispanic Society Museum & Library in Washington Heights from\u00a0through\u00a0August 31, 2025.
