[PrideFest](https://www.nycpride.org/event/pridefest), the annual street fair featuring food and activities for all ages, also returns.\n\nPre-party the day before at the South Street Seaport Museum with [Youth Pride](https://www.nycpride.org/event/youth-pride) and at the [NYC Dyke March](https://www.nycdykemarch.com/) \u2014 a \u201cprotest march, not a parade,\u201d according to the organizers \u2014 that steps off from Bryant Park at 5 p.m.\n\nOther Pride Month parades and festivals include: [Staten Island](https://www.pridecentersi.org/pride-festival-2025) (May 31); [Asbury Park, N.J.](https://jerseypride.org/) (June 1); [Queens](https://newqueenspride.org/) (June 1); [Westchester County, N.Y.](https://www.loftgaycenter.org/westchester_pride_hosted_by_the_loft) (June 1); [Long Island](https://lipride.org/) (June 8); [Woodstock, N.Y.](https://www.woodstocknypride.org/parade-2025) (June 8); [Brooklyn](https://brooklynpride.org/) (June 14); [Hudson, N.Y.](https://www.outhudsonny.com/) (June 21); [the Bronx](https://cbo.io/app/public/bidapp/bronxpridefestival) (June 21); and [Harlem](https://harlempride.org/) (June 28).\n\nWith so many dance-till-you-drop parties taking place over Pride weekend, now might be a good idea to take a Monday off. Two of the more popular ones are the [Brut Party](https://brutparty.com/event/nyc-pride-2025/) in Times Square (June 27), for the leather-and-harness set, and the 25th annual [Alegria](https://www.ricsenapresents.com/events/alegria-pride-2025) (June 29), which begins at 4:30 p.m. at Avant Gardner in Brooklyn and ends 24 hours later with Sunrise, a chill rooftop comedown.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[SKIP ADVERTISEMENT](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/29/arts/pride-events-nyc.html#after-story-ad-1)\n\nYour Pride Shows\n----------------\n\nThe Brick Theater, a multidisciplinary performing arts space in Brooklyn, is hosting several queer-themed shows through June. Among them are [T4T Fest](https://www.bricktheater.com/event/t4t-fest-by-trans-artists-for-trans-audiences/2025-06-03/) (June 3-8), a series of plays \u201cby trans artists, for trans audiences,\u201d and the ninth annual [Queer Butoh Festival](https://www.bricktheater.com/event/queer-butoh-2025/2025-06-25/) (June 25-28), \u200b\u200bfeaturing performers from Britain, Mexico and other countries.\n\n[Broadway Bares](https://broadwaycares.org/pre-event/broadway-bares-2025), the long-running strip-and-sing benefit for Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS, is back with two performances at the Hammerstein Ballroom in Midtown (June 22). The theme is the Wizard of Oz-inspired \u201cCome Out, Come Out\u201d; the \u201cStripper Spectacular\u201d package includes an invitation to a private cocktail party hosted by the Tony Award-winning director and choreographer Jerry Mitchell**.**\n\n[Subscribe to The Times](https://www.nytimes.com/subscription?campaignId=8WXW7) to read as many articles as you like.\n\nA version of this article appears in print on May 30, 2025, Section C, Page 11 of the New York edition with the headline: It\u2019s Time to Step Out and Join the Celebrations.
