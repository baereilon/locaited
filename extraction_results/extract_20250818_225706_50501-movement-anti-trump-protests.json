We are demanding a country that puts our families over their fortunes \u2013 public schools over private profits, healthcare over hedge funds, prosperity over free market politics.\u201d\n\n## Causes come together in united protests\n\nNew York City\u2019s first May Day protest on Thursday brought together several causes, with chants of \u201cFree Palestine,\u201d signs calling for the freedom of detained Columbia graduate [Mahmoud Khalil](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/24/us/mahmoud-khalil-arrest-news-update/index.html) and worker\u2019s rights signs reading, \u201cTrump: Hands Off Our Unions.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump has poor and working-class people forgetting who our enemies are,\u201d an organizer with the Party for Socialism and Liberation said to the large crowd gathered in New York City\u2019s Union Square. \u201cOur enemies are not international students that organize on their campus. Our enemies are not undocumented workers that contribute to their communities, that pay taxes and can\u2019t get services. Our enemies are not workers that work for corporations.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo \u2013 this racist, sexist, anti-worker, homophobic, xenophobic, transphobic system is our enemy,\u201d the organizer said as the crowd cheered in response.\n\nA group of roughly 150 people marched a little over 20 blocks from Union Square to the New York Public Library\u2019s Stephen A. Schwarzman Building, where the rallies continued on its front entrance steps.\n\nPeople gather at New York Public Library after marching during a May Day rally on Thursday.\n\nMichael M. Santiago/Getty Images\n\nDemonstrators chanted and cheered while carrying Palestinian flags and signs that read, \u201cPeople demand: Stop the deportations.\u201d Multiple speakers spoke about the government\u2019s [targeting of immigrants](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/26/politics/chicago-immigration-trump-ice/index.html) and the US funding to Israel for [weapons and military equipment](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/09/politics/us-releases-billions-israel-weapons-military-equipment/index.html) as the civilian death toll in Gaza continues to rise.\n\nDuring a second energetic May Day rally in New York City, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez told thousands of attendees, as estimated by CNN crew members, \u201cWhen they see us gather in the streets,\u201d Washington politicians get \u201cvery afraid.\u201d\n\nShe pointed to the large gatherings of people rallying for May Day in cities across the country, mentioning Sen. Bernie Sanders was at a rally with thousands of people in Philadelphia.\n\nThe Vermont senator spoke Thursday at City Hall in Philadelphia alongside labor unions and immigrant rights groups demonstrating against the current administration\u2019s recent policies and decisions.\n\n\u201cBrothers and sisters, we tell these greedy oligarchs this country belongs to all of us, not the billionaire class,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nProtesters waiting in anticipation for Sanders\u2019 speech told CNN they have concerns, including Kilmar Abrego Garcia\u2019s deportation and the administration\u2019s threats against students like Tufts University PhD student Rumeysa Ozturk, who was [snatched by masked immigration officers in broad daylight.](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/27/us/rumeysa-ozturk-detained-what-we-know)\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in distress,\u201d Kate Overath-Speck told CNN. \u201cI came out and demonstrated during his first regime, like every weekend, there was something to protest. But now we\u2019re not supposed to be protesters. We\u2019re supposed to be protectors of democracy, the rule of law, the US constitution.\u201d\n\nFollowing the Philadelphia rally, 70 demonstrators were arrested for obstructing a highway after officers issued multiple warnings to clear the roadway, the Philadelphia Police Department said Thursday night. Protesters were \u201cinspired by the actions of the Montgomery Bus Boycott, the March on Washington, and Dr. Martin Luther King and the Memphis Sanitation Workers\u2019 Strike,\u201d the Philadelphia AFL-CIO said in a news release.\n\n\u201cWhat we saw today, from the large crowds who rallied with us at City Hall, to the over 50 leaders and activists who were arrested with me earlier this evening, makes it abundantly clear that workers in Philly will not sit back while our rights are stripped away by billionaires like Donald Trump and Elon Musk,\u201d Philadelphia AFL-CIO President Daniel Bauder said.\n\nAs part of her speech, Ocasio-Cortez criticized the mass cuts to the federal workforce since the start of the Trump administration, along with the crackdown on immigration enforcement.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen our federal workers laid off, cuts across the board,\u201d she told the crowd. \u201cWe can see individuals calling for a ceasefire getting locked up,\u201d she said, alluding to protest organizers like Khalil.\n\n[People take part in a protest organised to 'Protect Migrants, Protect the Planet' on April 19, 2025 in New York City.

What began as an online movement quickly spilled into the streets, with at least four major demonstrations in the past four months.\n\nBefore the May Day protests, the most recent came [on April 19](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/19/us/50501-protests-trump-administration/index.html) when crowds of people attended over 80 protests at state capitols, courthouses and city halls in several states to oppose what organizers describe as President Donald Trump\u2019s executive overreach, including deportations without due process, the dismantling of federal agencies and threats to higher education.\n\n## Protesters demand the return of wrongfully deported man\n\nIn downtown Los Angeles, vast numbers of people rallied and chanted in opposition to the Trump administration and what speakers described as efforts to undermine Black and immigrant communities.\n\n\u201cThe real parasites of this country are those billionaires that are destroying this country\u2019s institutions,\u201d said Aquilina Soriano Versoza, the founder of the Pilipino Workers Center.\n\nThe crowd broke into multiple chants: \u201cWhen I say workers, you say power! When I say immigrants, you say power! When I say union, you say yes!\u201d\n\n\u201cEnough with the senseless attacks on our brothers and sisters who came to this country seeking a better life,\u201d said Carmen Roberts, vice president of SEIU Local 2015, the largest union in California representing over half a million long-term care workers.\n\n\u201cLet us choose unity over division,\u201d she said, adding \u201cS\u00ed, se puede,\u201d Spanish for \u201cYes, it can be done,\u201d a nod to [the rallying cry of the farm workers movement](https://www.cnn.com/2012/10/08/us/cesar-chavez-president-obama/index.html) led by C\u00e9sar E. Ch\u00e1vez, who fought for fair wages, humane treatment and safer working conditions for California\u2019s farm workers through nonviolent marches, boycotts and fasts.\n\nSimilar crowds made their way through the streets Washington, DC, where the wife of [Abrego Garcia](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/30/us/trump-could-bring-abrego-garcia-back-us-hnk/index.html), a Maryland man who was wrongly deported to El Salvador last month, spoke to demonstrators.\n\n\u201cMy husband was illegally detained, abducted and disappeared, thrown away to die in one of the most dangerous prisons in El Salvador with no due process because of an error,\u201d Jennifer Vasquez Sura said as the crowd responded with chants of \u201cshame.\u201d\n\nDemonstrators march during a May Day protest in Los Angeles, on Thursday.\n\nJae C.

Delia Catalina Ramirez, the daughter of Guatemalan immigrants, also spoke to DC protesters.\n\n\u201cWe understand that this president wants to divide us. He wants to pit us against each other,\u201d Ramirez said.\n\n\u201cBut look around, friends. We are Black, we are brown, we are Asian, we are Arab, we are Muslim, we are Jewish, we are White, we are working class and we are congresspeople saying, \u2018enough is enough.\u2019\u201d\n\nRamirez pointed to mobilization and actions such as the May Day protests as \u201cthe only thing that will stop fascism.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is what resistance looks like,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to try their best to continue to divide us.

When the government attacks even one person, they are attacking every American,\u201d Sahay said.\n\nProtesters hold up various signs and banners demanding Kilmar Abrego Garcia to be brought back to the US during a protest on Thursday, in Los Angeles.\n\nCNN\n\nThe protests come two days after Trump [marked 100 days in office](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/29/politics/donald-trump-actions-100-days-dg/index.html). In that short period, he has moved to upend the world order by instituting [tariffs](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/27/politics/tariffs-trump-trade-war/index.html) that threaten global trade; dismantling the administrative state under [the Department of Government Efficiency\u2019s slapdash cuts](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/26/politics/elon-musk-hostile-takeover-government-trump-100-days/index.html); rolling back [protections for transgender people](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/07/politics/supreme-court-lgbtq-skrmetti-switch/index.html); and exercising executive power with disdain for checks and balances.\n\nTrump\u2019s 41% approval rating is the lowest for any newly elected president at 100 days dating back at least to Dwight Eisenhower over six decades ago \u2013 including Trump\u2019s own first term, according to a [CNN poll conducted by SSRS](https://www.cnn.com/.element/interactive/2025/04/REL5a-Trump-at-100days.pdf). Approval of Trump\u2019s handling of the presidency is down 4 points [since March](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/12/politics/cnn-poll-trump-economy/index.html), and 7 points lower than it was in [late February](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/02/politics/poll-trump-negative-congress-address/index.html). Just 22% say they strongly approve of Trump\u2019s handling of the job, a new low, and about twice as many say they strongly disapprove (45%).\n\nVideo Ad Feedback\n\nHear from protesters rallying against Trump across the US\n\n00:51\n - Source:\n[CNN](https://www.cnn.com/)\n\nHear from protesters rallying against Trump across the US\n\n00:51\n\nTrump\u2019s first presidency was met with immediate mass protests in the form of the Women\u2019s March following Inauguration Dayin January 2017.
