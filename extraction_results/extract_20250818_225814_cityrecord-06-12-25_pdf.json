E j12 AGENCY RULES HEALTH AND MENTAL HYGIENE \u0084 NOTICE Notice of Adoption of Amendments to Department Rules Concerning Violation Fines and Penalties.\nA notice of public hearing and opportunity to comment on proposed amendments of the penalty schedule of Chapter 7 of Title 24 of the Rules of the City of New York (\u201cRCNY\u201d) was published in the City Record on February 5, 2025 by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (\u201cDepartment\u201d). The amendments add violation penalties for requirements under: (a) New York City Health Code (\u201cHealth Code\u201d) Articles 143 (Disposal of Sewage), 161 (Animals), 165 (Bathing Establishments), 167 (Bathing Beaches), 175 (Radiation Control) and 177 (Tanning Facilities); (b) Subchapter 3 (Rental Horse Licensing and Protection Law) of Chapter 3 (Licenses and Permits) of Title 17 of the New York City Administrative Code (\u201cAdministrative Code\u201d); and, (c) Chapter 4 (Health, Safety and Well-being of Rental Horses) of Title 24 of the RCNY. A virtual public hearing on these amendments was held on March 10, 2025. One person testified at the hearing and three written comments were received. The individual who testified, and also supplied written comments, expressed concern, in relevant part, regarding what they view is a lack of specificity for certain violation descriptions. The Department responds by stating that the penalty schedule does not require modification because the proposed violation descriptions provide notice to the alleged violator of what section of law has been violated and its potential penalty. This individual also provided an additional two comments, stating that they do not believe the proposed penalty increases will improve compliance or safety, and a comment concerning the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings\u2019 service of process rules, which is outside the scope of this rule. Another commenter expressed concern over the percentage increase in proposed penalties for certain sauna and/or steam room violations under Health Code \u00a7165.63. The Department responds that these penalty increases are in accordance with Health Code \u00a73.11(a) and are reasonable for safeguarding patron safety. Finally, one commenter wrote to express concern over the annual cleaning of domestic water tanks, which is outside the scope of this rule. In response to the above comments, the Department has not made any substantive changes to the proposed rules. However, on its own initiative, the Department has decided to remove the proposed penalties for violations of Article 141 in this rulemaking, and will include those penalties in a separate, subsequent rulemaking. The Department now adopts the amended rule as provided below.\nStatement of Basis and Purpose of Rules The Department amends the Penalty Schedule of Appendix 7-A of Chapter 7 of Title 24 of the RCNY to provide penalties for certain violations enforced by the Department in order to provide fixed, consistent enforcement of civil penalties. These violations correspond to provisions in: (i) Health Code Articles 143 (Disposal of Sewage), 161 (Animals), 165 (Bathing Establishments), 167 (Bathing Beaches), 175 (Radiation Control) and 177 (Tanning Facilities); (ii) Subchapter 3 (Rental Horse Licensing and Protection Law) of Chapter 3 (Licenses and Permits) of Title 17 of the New York City Administrative Code; and (iii) Chapter 4 (Health, Safety and Well-being of Rental Horses) of Title 24 of the RCNY.\nThese amendments also add a new section 7-12 that fixes the penalty at $250 (which is doubled if respondent defaults) for violations of Articles 143, 161, 165, 167, 175 and 177 that are not listed in Appendix 7-A.\n\u201cShall\u201d and \u201cmust\u201d denote mandatory requirements and may be used interchangeably in the rules of the Department, unless otherwise specified or unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.\nThe amendments are as follows: Deleted material is in [brackets]. New text is underlined. THE CITY RECORD\b THURSDAY, JUNE 12, 2025 3270 Section 1.\tChapter 7 of Title 24 of the Rules of the City of New York is amended to add a new section 7-12, to read as follows: \u00a77-12 Fines for violations of New York City Health Code Articles 143, 161, 165, 167, 175 and 177 not listed in Appendix 7-A.\nThe penalty for a violation of any provision of New York City Health Code Article 143 (Disposal of Sewage), Article 161 (Animals), Article 165 (Bathing Establishments), Article 167 (Bathing Beaches), Article 175 (Radiation Control), or Article 177 (Tanning Facilities) that is not listed in Appendix 7-A of this Chapter is $250. The penalty will be doubled to $500 if the respondent fails to appear to answer a summons and is found in default.\n\u00a7 2.

The FEIS and NOC are available for review on CEQR Access, https://a002-ceqraccess.nyc.gov/ceqr/ (search CEQR # 24DME011X). The Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) was issued on January 17, 2025. A public hearing on the DEIS was held in conjunction with the public hearing on the associated Uniform Land Use Review Procedure (ULURP) application on April 23, 2025. The public comment period was scheduled to close on May 4, 2025, but was extended to and closed on May 22, 2025.\nThe Applicant, Bally\u2019s New York Operating Company, LLC, seeks a series of discretionary land use actions to facilitate the Proposed Development, including an approximately 3,093,880-gross-square-foot (gsf) gaming facility and the widening and mapping of Ring Road as a city street. The Proposed Facility would include 561,320 gsf of gaming space and a variety of food and beverage services; a 509,330 gsf, 500-key hotel with a spa and meeting space; 6,100 gsf for sundry retail; a 2,000-seat event center; and a 1,941,910 gsf parking garage for 4,660 vehicles. During peak business hours at the Proposed Facility there would be 5,800 visitors and up to 650 employees. The Proposed Development is expected to generate 3,500 jobs. The Applicant has operated the Golf Course since September 2023 pursuant to a license agreement with the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation (NYC Parks). As part of the Proposed Development, the Applicant would construct a 40,160 gsf, replacement standalone clubhouse for the Golf Course, which would remain as currently configured and would continue to be open to the public during the entire construction time period.\nThe Proposed Actions for the Bally\u2019s Bronx Project include multiple City approvals subject to ULURP, including discretionary actions subject to New York State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA) and CEQR and are shown below.\nRequired City Approvals - A City Map Amendment to demap a portion of the Development Site (the \u201cDisposition Parcel\u201d) as parkland allowing for the disposition of an interest in those areas; - A City Map Amendment to map the widened Ring Road as a City Street; - A Zoning Map Amendment to designate existing parkland as a C8-4 commercial zoning district, in which gaming facilities are permitted pursuant to NYC Zoning Resolution Sections 32-10 (32-18, 32-181, 32-183) and 42-10 (42-18, 42-181, 42-183); - Approval for the disposition of City-owned real property to facilitate the transfer of a non-exclusive access easement or other similar agreement over the Waterfront Access Roadway necessary for the Proposed Development from the City of New York (through NYC Parks) to Bally\u2019s; and - The extension and modification of the existing Golf Course Concession, through a renewal concession and/or a lease, to facilitate the long-term operation of the public Golf Course by Bally\u2019s.\nIn addition, coordination and approvals for public improvements will be required from City agencies such as NYC Parks, NYCDOT, and NYCDEP. Required State Approvals - State Legislation and Governor\u2019s Approval to authorize the alienation and disposition of parkland within Ferry Point Park (the Park); - Approval by the Gaming Facility Location Board and issuance of a gaming license from the New York State Gaming Commission to allow the operation of the Proposed Facility; and - Approval from the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) of a \u201cChange of Use Workplan\u201d to allow the use of and construction on the Development Site because it is part of a closed landfill.\nOther State approvals include approval from NYSDEC for stormwater discharges during construction and from the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) and potentially other State agencies to facilitate certain street improvements near the Hutchinson River Expressway. In addition, coordination (or approvals for public improvements) may be required with State agencies or authorities such as the MTA (including NYCT and TBTA). The Proposed Development would also include various ministerial actions, such as approval from the Public Design Commission (PDC) for the replacement golf clubhouse.\nCopies of the FEIS and NOC for
