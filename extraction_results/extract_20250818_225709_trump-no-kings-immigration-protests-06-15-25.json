Canada](https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-no-kings-immigration-protests-06-15-25#cmbye1ibd000j3b6qazt91i43) for the Group of 7 summit, where the spiraling conflict [between Israel and Iran](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-strikes-news-06-15-25) will compete with other global flashpoints for attention from the heads of the world\u2019s leading economies.\n\n\u2022 **Israel-Iran tensions:** The summit [comes as Trump opposed](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/15/politics/us-military-trump-israel-iran) an Israeli plan to kill Iran\u2019s supreme leader, according to two sources. The president is making publicly and privately clear he prefers to keep the United States out of the fray for now.\n\n\u2022 **Nationwide protests:**More than 2,000 [\u201cNo Kings\u201d](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/14/us/gallery/no-kings-protests) rallies took place across the country Saturday, drawing large crowds to protest what organizers call Trump\u2019s \u201cauthoritarianism, billionaire-first politics, and the militarization of our democracy.\u201d The nationwide rallies coincided with a grand display of military might in the nation\u2019s capital as Trump [presided over a parade](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/14/politics/trump-us-army-military-parade) to celebrate the Army\u2019s 250th birthday.\n\n\u2022 **Immigration crackdown:**Saturday\u2019s demonstrations came after a week of protests against ICE raids in communities with large immigrant populations, with [Los Angeles serving](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/15/us/ice-raids-migrants-la-protests) as a flashpoint for the nation. A legal battle is unfolding over [Trump deploying troops to California](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/12/politics/trump-national-guard-california-breyer) in response to the unrest.\n\nAll Catch Up Protests\n\n16 Posts\n\n_Our live coverage of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency has ended for the day.

The event told the story of the Army through its 250-year history, beginning with the Revolutionary War and tracing through major conflicts. The parade featured several million pounds of military hardware, including dozens of M1-A1 Abrams tanks and Bradley and Stryker fighting vehicles as well as Howitzers and other artillery pieces. \n*   **Nationwide protests:**While the president was focused on the military parade in DC, scores of Americans attended [\u201cNo Kings\u201d protests](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/13/us/military-parade-protests-trump) around the country.
