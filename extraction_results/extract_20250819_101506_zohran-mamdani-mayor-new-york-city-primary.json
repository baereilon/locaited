He\u2019s capitalized on progressive frustration with [Andrew Cuomo](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/21/politics/andrew-cuomo-donald-trump-new-york-mayor), the former New York governor mounting a political comeback with a mayoral run; in one of his videos, he explains [New York City\u2019s ranked-choice voting system](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/14/politics/ranked-choice-voting-new-york-city-how-it-works) in Hindi and Urdu and likens Cuomo to a Bollywood villain.\n\nNow running as Cuomo\u2019s top rival in Tuesday\u2019s primary, Mamdani\u2019s rise has also caused growing consternation from the Democratic establishment. His critics argue his platform is too far to the left for moderates and certain to be weaponized by local and national Republicans trying to paint the Democratic Party as out of touch. He\u2019s also faced criticism about how he\u2019s addressed the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nAd Feedback\n\nThat concern was hard to find at Thursday\u2019s festival in Queens. Mamdani stood onstage awkwardly but joyfully two-stepping and swaying side to side next to other candidates in the primary. Then he walked through the park on a sweltering day, joking that he was fine in his wool suit because he had on an undershirt.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a campaign that is powered by the hunger of New Yorkers for a new generation of leadership,\u201d Mamdani told CNN.\n\nHere\u2019s what to know about Mamdani and his campaign.\n\n![Image 2: Mamdani travels by subway between campaign events, in Brooklyn on May 27.](https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/02-gettyimages-2217338477.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill)\n\nMamdani travels by subway between campaign events, in Brooklyn on May 27.\n\nAndrew Lichtenstein/Corbis News/Getty Images\n\nWho is Zohran Mamdani?\n----------------------\n\nMamdani is a three-term state assemblyman who represents parts of Queens, one the most diverse areas in the nation.\n\nHe is an immigrant from Uganda who was first raised in Cape Town, South Africa, and later in New York City, attending the prestigious Bronx High School of Science before enrolling at Bowdoin College. He is the son of Mahmood Mamdani, a professor at Columbia University, and Mira Nair, an Indian filmmaker whose credits include \u201cMississippi Masala\u201d and \u201cMonsoon Wedding.\u201d\n\nPrior to his mayoral campaign, Mamdani made national headlines in 2021 when he joined New York City cab drivers on a 15-day hunger strike seeking relief from excessive debt. He also moonlighted as a rapper under the stage name Mr. Cardamom rapping about chapati, an Indian flatbread, and worked as foreclosure prevention counselor.\n\nIf elected mayor, he would become one of the youngest people to ever hold the post. Mamdani would also become the first Muslim mayor in the history of the city \u2014 home to more than half a million Muslims and one of the largest Jewish populations outside of Israel.\n\nWhat are his policy proposals?\n------------------------------\n\nMamdani wants to freeze the rent for nearly 1 million New Yorkers living in rent-stabilized apartments and provide free city bus service, universal childcare and city-subsidized grocery stores.\n\nMamdani has said he will pay for it all by raising taxes on the city\u2019s wealthiest, even though he would have little power to do so from City Hall. Taxes can be raised or lowered only by state lawmakers with approval from the governor. Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul has already thrown cold water on the proposal, saying the move is likely to drive more New Yorkers out of the concrete jungle and toward Florida and other lower-tax destinations.\n\n![Image 3: Mamdani supporters attend a rally at a nightclub in Williamsburg on May 4.](https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/03-gettyimages-2214866004.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill)\n\nMamdani supporters attend a rally at a nightclub in Williamsburg on May 4.\n\nAndrew Lichtenstein/Corbis News/Getty Images\n\nMamdani\u2019s campaign has raised $7 million from thousands of individual donors and mobilized an army of volunteers. He secured the endorsement of Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and the United Auto Workers union.\n\n\u201cThis race is not just symbolic about the future of New York City, this race is symbolic about the future of our country,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said during a campaign rally packed with more than 2,000 supporters last week. \u201cFor so long we have had political leadership, including in the Democratic Party, that has just wanted to play it safe.\u201d\n\nWhy are establishment Democrats worried?\n----------------------------------------\n\nDemocratic establishment concern was laid out in a recent call held by Third Way, a national think tank that favors a centrist political agenda. The group released a memo last week, warning that a Mamdani\u2019s win would be \u201ca devastating blow in the fight to defeat Trumpism.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really worried about all Democrats going forward if Mamdani were to win,\u201d Matt Bennett, executive vice president for public affairs, told reporters during the call. \u201cEven if he doesn\u2019t win the election, if he just wins the Democratic nomination, that can hurt Democrats.\u201d\n\nCuomo has made his long career in government and experience with President [Donald Trump](https://www.cnn.com/politics/president-donald-trump-47) the cornerstones of his comeback run. He dismisses Mamdani as an inexperienced leader with unrealistic ideas and suggests Trump would run through Mamdani like \u201ca hot knife through butter.\u201d\n\n![Image 4: Democratic mayoral candidates Andrew Cuomo, left, and Mamdani, second from right, present arguments as Whitney Tilson, second from left, and Michael Blake, right, look on during a Democratic mayoral primary debate in New York on June 4.](https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/04-gettyimages-2218001354.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill)\n\nDemocratic mayoral candidates Andrew Cuomo, left, and Mamdani, second from right, present arguments as Whitney Tilson, second from left, and Michael Blake, right, look on during a Democratic mayoral primary debate in New York on June 4.\n\nYuki Iwamura/Pool/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s never done any of the essentials. And now you have Donald Trump on top of all of that,\u201d Cuomo said during a recent debate.\n\nMamdani has responded by zeroing in on Cuomo\u2019s [sexual harassment scandals](https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/26/politics/doj-cuomo-sexual-harassment-new-york), his reputation as a bully and his billionaire donors. Cuomo has repeatedly denied the misconduct allegations.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never had to resign in disgrace,\u201d Mamdani said during one debate. \u201cI have never hounded the 13 women who credibly accused me of sexual harassment. I have never sued for their gynecological records. And I have never done these things because I am not you, Mr. Cuomo.\u201d\n\nHow has Mamdani addressed antisemitism?\n---------------------------------------\n\nCuomo and other rivals of Mamdani have called out how he\u2019s spoken about antisemitism and the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nMamdani has accused the Israeli government of carrying out a \u201cgenocide.\u201d And he defended the use of the slogan \u201cglobalize the intifada\u201d as a rallying cry for Palestinian human rights during an interview with The Bulwark.\n\nMamdani said he believed the phrase was about \u201ca desperate desire for equality and equal rights in standing up for Palestinian human rights,\u201d explaining that the US Holocaust Museum used a similar Arabic word meaning \u201cuprising\u201d to describe the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising against the Nazis.\n\n\u201cI have shared my opinions with New Yorkers over the course of this race, opinions that always come back to a belief in universal human rights, that means taking on antisemitism and Islamophobia,\u201d Mamdani told CNN.\n\nMamdani\u2019s campaign has proposed making an increase of 800% for the city\u2019s anti-hate crime program.\n\n![Image 5: Mamdani prepares ahead of a debate at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York on June 12.](https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/05-2025-06-13t015609z-1655466824-rc2a1faermo8-rtrmadp-3-usa-election-new-york.jpg?q=w_1110,c_fill)\n\nMamdani prepares ahead of a debate at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York on June 12.\n\nVincent Alban/Pool/Reuters\n\nStill, the criticism to those comments came fast and furious. Mamdani was condemned by the Holocaust Museum and some fellow Democrats for using a phrase they believe encourages violence against Jews.\n\nCity Comptroller [Brad Lander](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/19/politics/who-is-brad-lander-ice-arrest), who is running third behind Mamdani and has cross-endorsed him under the primary\u2019s ranked-choice system, said he preferred Mamdani avoid the term altogether.\n\nMamdani\u2019s reaction was equally visceral. He became emotional and cried while speaking with reporters about the backlash, detailing the multiple threats and the near-constant harassing calls his office now receives on a daily basis.\n\n\u201cIt pains me to be painted as if I am somehow to the very Jewish New Yorkers that I know and love that are such a key part of this city,\u201d Mamdani said. \u201cWhen I speak, when I speak with emotion I am characterized by rivals as being a monster. I get messages that say, \u2018The only good Muslim is a dead Muslim.\u2019 I get threats on my life, on the people that I love.\u201d\n\nHe has also accused a pro-Cuomo PAC of designing a campaign mailer that featured his photo appearing to be altered to make his beard look darker and thicker next to text saying Mamdani \u201crejects Jewish rights.\u201d The Cuomo campaign said it never sent out the mailer and it was made up by an independent vendor.\n\nWhat has he said about US strikes on Iran?\n------------------------------------------\n\nMamdani called the strikes ordered by Trump \u201ca new, dark chapter in his endless series of betrayals.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile Donald Trump bears immediate responsibility for this illegal escalation, these actions are the result of a political
