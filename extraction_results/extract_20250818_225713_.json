Tax on Social Security is a Reality in the One Big Beautiful Bill\n====================================================================\n\n The White House\n\nJuly 1, 2025\n\n**Under the One Big Beautiful Bill, the vast majority of senior citizens \u2014 88% of all seniors who receive Social Security \u2014 will pay NO TAX on their Social Security benefits, according to a**[**brand new analysis**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/The-One-Big-Beautiful-Bill-Delivers-On-President-Trumps-Promise-Of-No-Tax-On-Social-Security.pdf)**from the Council of Economic Advisers.**\n\n![Image 2](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/opt-socialsecurity-cea-1.jpg)\n*   A senior who files as a single taxpayer and receives the current average retirement benefit ([approx. $24,000](https://www.ssa.gov/faqs/en/questions/KA-01903.html)) will see deductions that exceed their taxable Social Security income.\n*   Married seniors who both receive the average $24,000 Social Security income \u2014 a total of $48,000 in annual income \u2014 will also see deductions that exceed their taxable Social Security income.\n\n![Image

years of earning their Social Security, seniors can save more of their money.\n\nPromises made, promises kept.\n\n*   [News](https://www.whitehouse.gov/news/)\n*
