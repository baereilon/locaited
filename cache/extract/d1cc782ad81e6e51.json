The Met [says](https://www.metmuseum.org/press-releases/ci-2025-exhibition-gala-details) its annual theme is designed to \u201cprovide guidance and invite creative interpretation.\u201d\n\nVideo Ad Feedback\n\nSymbolism, tribute and spectacle: A deeper look at the 2025 Met Gala\n\n01:45\n - Source:\n[CNN](https://www.cnn.com/)\n\nSymbolism, tribute and spectacle: A deeper look at the 2025 Met Gala\n\n01:45\n\nIt did both, with many attendees putting a contemporary spin on zoot suits, the wide-shouldered, high-waisted suits popularized by African American men in the 1940s. Speaking to CNN ahead of his arrival at the gala, fashion designer Dapper Dan said \u201creal dandyism\u201d began with zoot suits, jazz and the Harlem Renaissance movement. \u201cIt\u2019s when Black artists and creatives began to dress the way they felt,\u201d he added.\n\nThis year marked the first Met Gala dress code centered on menswear, challenging designers to reinterpret tailoring traditions for their female clients. The red carpet was awash with exaggerated suiting, from the broad shoulders of Doja Cat\u2019s 1980s-inspired Marc Jacobs blazer to the wide-lapeled jackets sported by everyone from actor Tessa Thompson to rapper Doechii.\n\nJanelle Mon\u00e1e wowed with a suit-within a suit \u2014 an outerwear jacket, printed with a blazer and necktie, that she removed to reveal an actual suit (she completed the look with a bowler hat and a clock monocle with spinning hands). Other standout tailored looks included Zendaya\u2019s Louis Vuitton three-piece and Lupita Nyong\u2019o\u2019s all-aquamarine Chanel look with a matching chiffon cape and hat.\n\nJanelle Mon\u00e1e arrived in a long jacket printed to resemble a suit and necktie, as well as a bowler hat and monocle.\n\nMichael Buckner/Penske Media/Getty Images\n\nThe singer and actor then removed the jacket to reveal a time-traveler-inspired black-and-red Thom Browne outfit.\n\nChristopher Polk/Shutterstock\n\nThe evening\u2019s men also embraced colorful, theatrical suiting: \u201cBridgerton\u201d actor Reg\u00e9-Jean Page in all red, Henry Golding in \u2014 fittingly \u2014 gold and musician Bad Bunny in a loose-fitting brown two-piece paired with a Puerto Rican pava hat.\n\nElsewhere, attendees used the theme to pay homage to individual Black icons. In the first of two red-carpet looks, Oscar-nominated actor Colman Domingo, one of the Met Gala\u2019s co-chairs, arrived in a blue Valentino cape that evoked Vogue\u2019s former editor-at-large Andr\u00e9 Leon Talley. Formula 1 driver (and fellow co-chair) Lewis Hamilton said his patent leather shoes were also a reference to the late fashion journalist \u2014 as was Anne Hathaway\u2019s white-button down shirt and Carolina Herrera column dress.\n\n[NEW YORK, NY - MAY 04: Rihanna attends the \"China: Through The Looking Glass\" Costume Institute Benefit Gala at the Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 4, 2015 in New York City.
