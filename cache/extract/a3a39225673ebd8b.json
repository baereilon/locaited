Share)\n\nX CEO Linda Yaccarino said she\u2019s stepping down after two bumpy years running Elon Musk\u2019s social media platform.\n\nYaccarino posted a positive message Wednesday about her tenure at the company formerly known as Twitter and said \u201cthe best is yet to come as X enters a new chapter with\u201d Musk\u2019s artificial intelligence company xAI, maker of the chatbot Grok. She did not say why she is leaving.\n\nMusk responded to Yaccarino\u2019s announcement with his own 5-word statement on X: \u201cThank you for your contributions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe only thing that\u2019s surprising about Linda Yaccarino\u2019s resignation is that it didn\u2019t come sooner,\u201d said Forrester research director Mike Proulx. \u201cIt was clear from the start that she was being set up to fail by a limited scope as the company\u2019s chief executive.\u201d\n\nIn reality, Proulx added, Musk \u201cis and always has been at the helm of X. And that made Linda X\u2019s CEO in title only, which is a very tough position to be in, especially for someone of Linda\u2019s talents.\u201d\n\n[Musk hired Yaccarino](https://apnews.com/article/twitter-elon-musk-new-ceo-linda-yaccarino-7c9a549420b5b1d1b2f050164d96055d), a veteran ad executive, in May 2023 after [buying Twitter for $44 billion](https://apnews.com/article/elon-musk-twitter-deal-live-updates-78d68790fb0b9971d6e65b76d97e3670) in late 2022 and cutting most of its staff. He said at the time that Yaccarino\u2019s role would be focused mainly on running the company\u2019s business operations, leaving him to [focus on product design and new technology.](https://apnews.com/article/elon-musk-technology-business-d9d168951c98192ef90851085f343332) Before announcing her hiring, Musk said whoever took over as the company\u2019s CEO \u201c [must like pain a lot](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1604626103326253056?lang=en).\u201d\n\n[Musk's xAI scrubs inappropriate posts after Grok chatbot makes antisemitic comments](https://apnews.com/article/elon-musk-chatbot-ai-grok-d745a7e3d0a7339a1159dc6c42475e29)\n\n[Tesla announces November annual meeting under pressure from shareholders](https://apnews.com/article/tesla-grok-musk-x-chatbot-xai-trump-ce3e7da4ec6ccf0e8c5e30772af53540)\n\n[Musk's latest Grok chatbot searches for billionaire mogul's views before answering questions](https://apnews.com/article/grok-4-elon-musk-xai-colossus-14d575fb490c2b679ed3111a1c83f857)\n\nIn accepting the job, Yaccarino was [taking on the challenge](https://apnews.com/article/twitter-musk-yaccarino-ceo-women-glass-cliff-233e5eada047694aa743af2e310875e7) of getting big brands back to advertising on the social media platform after months of upheaval following Musk\u2019s takeover. She also had to work in a supporting role to Musk\u2019s outsized persona on and off of X as he loosened content moderation rules in the name of free speech and restored accounts previously banned by the social media platform.\n\n\u201cBeing the CEO of X was always going to be a tough job, and Yaccarino lasted in the role longer than many expected. Faced with a mercurial owner who never fully stepped away from the helm and continued to use the platform as his personal megaphone, Yaccarino had to try to run the business while also regularly putting out fires,\u201d said Emarketer analyst Jasmine Enberg.\n\nYaccarino\u2019s future at X became unclear earlier this year after Musk [merged the social media platform](https://apnews.com/article/x-musk-sale-xai-b245f463076ac9b72c41f92160dc77eb) with his artificial intelligence company, xAI. And the advertising issues have not subsided. Since Musk\u2019s takeover, a number of companies had pulled back on ad spending \u2014 the platform\u2019s chief source of revenue \u2014 over concerns that Musk\u2019s thinning of content restrictions was enabling hateful and toxic speech to flourish.\n\nMost recently, an update to Grok led to a [flood of antisemitic commentary](https://apnews.com/article/elon-musk-chatbot-ai-grok-d745a7e3d0a7339a1159dc6c42475e29) from the chatbot this week that included praise of Adolf Hitler.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of recent posts made by Grok and are actively working to remove the inappropriate posts,\u201d the Grok account posted on X early Wednesday, without being more specific.\n\nSome experts have tied Grok\u2019s behavior to Musk\u2019s deliberate efforts to mold Grok as an alternative to chatbots he considers too \u201cwoke,\u201d such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Gemini. In late June, he invited X users to help train the chatbot on their commentary in a way that invited a flood of racist responses and conspiracy theories.\n\n\u201cPlease reply to this post with divisive facts for [@Grok](https://x.com/grok) training,\u201d Musk said in the June 21 post. \u201cBy this I mean things that are politically incorrect, but nonetheless factually true.\u201d\n\nA similar instruction was later baked into Grok\u2019s \u201cprompts\u201d that instruct it on how to respond, which told the chatbot to \u201cnot shy away from making claims which are politically incorrect, as long as they are well substantiated.\u201d That part of the instructions was later deleted.\n\n\u201cTo me, this has all the fingerprints of Elon\u2019s involvement,\u201d said Talia Ringer, a professor of computer science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.\n\nYaccarino has not publicly commented on the latest hate speech controversy. She has, at times, ardently defended Musk\u2019s approach, including in a lawsuit against liberal advocacy group Media Matters for America over a report that claimed leading advertisers\u2019 posts on X were appearing alongside neo-Nazi and white nationalist content. The report led some advertisers to pause their activity on X.\n\nA federal judge last year dismissed X\u2019s lawsuit against another nonprofit, the Center for Countering Digital Hate, which has documented the [increase in hate speech](https://apnews.com/article/elon-musk-lawsuit-cchd-twitter-x-hate-speech-extremism-434a80631f9e76833ee30387c04dd290) on the site since it was acquired by Musk.\n\nX is also in an ongoing legal dispute with major advertisers \u2014 including CVS, Mars, Lego, Nestle, Shell and Tyson Foods \u2014 over what it has alleged was a \u201cmassive advertiser boycott\u201d that deprived the company of billions of dollars in revenue and violated antitrust laws.\n\nEnberg said that, \u201cto a degree, Yaccarino accomplished what she was hired to do.\u201d Emarketer expects X\u2019s ad business to return to growth in 2025 after more than halving between 2022 and 2023 following Musk\u2019s takeover.\n\nBut, she added, \u201cthe reasons for X\u2019s ad recovery are complicated, and Yaccarino was unable to restore the platform\u2019s reputation among advertisers.\u201d\n\nAnalysts have said that some advertisers may have returned to X to avoid alienating Trump supporters during the height of Musk\u2019s affiliation with the president and his base. Legal threats may have also played a part \u2014 whether from X or from the Federal Trade Commission, which is investigating Media Matters over its reporting that hateful content has increased on X since Musk took over, resulting in an advertiser exodus. Media Matters has in turn sued the FTC, claiming it seeks to punish protected speech.\n\n[MATT O\u2019BRIEN](https://apnews.com/author/matt-obrien)\n\nO\u2019Brien covers the business of technology and artificial intelligence for The Associated Press.\n\n[BARBARA ORTUTAY](https://apnews.com/author/barbara-ortutay)\n\nOrtutay writes about social media and the internet for The Associated Press.\n\n[mailto](mailto:bortutay@ap.org)",
