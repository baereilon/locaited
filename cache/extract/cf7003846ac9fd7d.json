Mayor Adams\u2019 Best Budget Ever increased DCLA\u2019s baseline funding by an additional $45 million, the first substantial increase in over a decade. That funding includes an additional $23.5 million for the city\u2019s Cultural Development Fund, which supports programming at over 1,000 cultural nonprofits across the city each year, helps create jobs, and strengthens the city\u2019s flourishing cultural sector. The $45 million baseline increase also includes an additional $21.5 million in baseline funding for the city\u2019s CIG network \u2014 34 private, non-profit cultural organizations on city-owned property, including museums, performing arts centers, historical societies, zoos, botanical gardens, and more. Along with a total expense investment of nearly $215 million in DCLA for FY 2026, Mayor Adams Best Budget Ever also includes $3.1 billion for cultural institutions and libraries through the 10-Year Capital Plan. Each year, DCLA supports more than 1,000 cultural nonprofits in all corners of the city. From small, volunteer-run community arts groups to some of the most visited and iconic cultural institutions in the city, these groups represent the full breadth of the city\u2019s rich cultural life. With the $45 million in baseline funding, DCLA can provide stable, long-term support for this critical sector in New York City, especially as it faces a range of new challenges.\n\nThe Adams administration has prioritized supporting cultural institutions across the five boroughs by, among other things, breaking ground on renovations, expansions, and other city-supported capital projects at the[Brooklyn Children\u2019s Museum](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flinks-1.govdelivery.com%2FCL0%2Fhttps%3A%252F%252Fwww.nyc.gov%252Fsite%252Fdcla%252Fabout%252Fpressrelease%252FPR-2024-8-13-DCLA-and-DDC-Break-Ground-on-Brooklyn-Childrens-Museum-Garden-Renovation.page%253Futm_medium%3Demail%2526utm_name%3D%2526utm_source%3Dgovdelivery%2F1%2F010001975ab4fb5b-34d564a9-5498-4065-93db-b409bc20d1de-000000%2FKSbHhCdf_lZPallleaI-u2pC3hgF7OtuTATa8JhwLWQ%3D409&data=05%7C02%7CCLong%40oti.nyc.gov%7C49143556480b4e3681be08dda83d372f%7C73d61799c28440228d4154cc4f1929ef%7C0%7C0%7C638851703069029673%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=Atv8EDDViJYYg610mwmR81YNLHe1xeRjI3fpSCYnQfc%3D&reserved=0),[Weeksville Heritage Center](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flinks-1.govdelivery.com%2FCL0%2Fhttps%3A%252F%252Fwww.nyc.gov%252Fsite%252Fddc%252Fabout%252Fpress-releases%252F2024%252Fpr-100324-Weeksville.page%253Futm_medium%3Demail%2526utm_name%3D%2526utm_source%3Dgovdelivery%2F1%2F010001975ab4fb5b-34d564a9-5498-4065-93db-b409bc20d1de-000000%2FdGQFsKnxL5H-V8zEJxFUcsMOmjGMMnng5E7IKjPYiY4%3D409&data=05%7C02%7CCLong%40oti.nyc.gov%7C49143556480b4e3681be08dda83d372f%7C73d61799c28440228d4154cc4f1929ef%7C0%7C0%7C638851703069045403%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=wStv6a%2Bkti7EsKDw8rabkjbtvTr40PMxuvBudSUdbgc%3D&reserved=0),[The Bronx Museum](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flinks-1.govdelivery.com%2FCL0%2Fhttps%3A%252F%252Fwww.nyc.gov%252Fsite%252Fdcla%252Fabout%252Fpressrelease%252FPR-2024-7-11-DCLA-EDC-Break-Ground-on-Bronx-Museum-Renovation.page%253Futm_medium%3Demail%2526utm_name%3D%2526utm_source%3Dgovdelivery%2F1%2F010001975ab4fb5b-34d564a9-5498-4065-93db-b409bc20d1de-000000%2FbuVrF7yyDp5mUClyyqf3dMPrh13NqM5cIRKvXtPwoTQ%3D409&data=05%7C02%7CCLong%40oti.nyc.gov%7C49143556480b4e3681be08dda83d372f%7C73d61799c28440228d4154cc4f1929ef%7C0%7C0%7C638851703069058856%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=Qhu289%2FIss9bHzV53COxZXDOT4Yv1BMKuU%2FGoANkPM4%3D&reserved=0),[Nuyorican Poets Caf\u00e9](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flinks-1.govdelivery.com%2FCL0%2Fhttps%3A%252F%252Fwww.nyc.gov%252Fsite%252Fdcla%252Fabout%252Fpressrelease%252FPR-2024-03-28-City-Begins-%25252424-Million-Renovation-of-Nuyorican%252520Poets-Cafe-on-Lower-East-Side.page%253Futm_medium%3Demail%2526utm_name%3D%2526utm_source%3Dgovdelivery%2F1%2F010001975ab4fb5b-34d564a9-5498-4065-93db-b409bc20d1de-000000%2F55QSFmOeW3KzspMxfx09VPdAVPmunBnoke6N8rAntZs%3D409&data=05%7C02%7CCLong%40oti.nyc.gov%7C49143556480b4e3681be08dda83d372f%7C73d61799c28440228d4154cc4f1929ef%7C0%7C0%7C638851703069071105%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=3IzOKzvtJq54RlEZ3cDXnNqOWB%2Fc2m3bUQaiJ%2BJZGrI%3D&reserved=0), and more in 2024.
