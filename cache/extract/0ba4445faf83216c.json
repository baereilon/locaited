The winners of the war, the [Allies](/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_I \"Allies of World War I\"), met to decide on formal peace terms at the [Paris Peace Conference](/wiki/Paris_Peace_Conference_(1919%E2%80%931920) \"Paris Peace Conference (1919\u20131920)\"). The [League of Nations](/wiki/League_of_Nations \"League of Nations\") was approved and started operations, but the [United States](/wiki/United_States \"United States\") never joined. On 10 January 1920, the League of Nations formally came into being when the [Covenant of the League of Nations](/wiki/Covenant_of_the_League_of_Nations \"Covenant of the League of Nations\"), ratified by 42 nations in 1919, took effect.[[3]](#cite_note-3) The League Council acted as an executive body directing the Assembly's business. It began with four permanent members\u2014the [United Kingdom](/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland \"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland\"), [France](/wiki/France \"France\"), [Italy](/wiki/Italy \"Italy\"), and [Japan](/wiki/Japan \"Japan\").\n\nAfter some limited successes and failures during the 1920s, the League proved ineffective in the 1930s, as it failed to act against the [Japanese invasion of Manchuria](/wiki/Japanese_invasion_of_Manchuria \"Japanese invasion of Manchuria\") in 1933. Forty nations voted for Japan to withdraw from [Manchuria](/wiki/Manchuria \"Manchuria\") but Japan voted against it and walked out of the League instead of withdrawing from Manchuria.[[4]](#cite_note-4) It also failed to act against the [Second Italo-Ethiopian War](/wiki/Second_Italo-Ethiopian_War \"Second Italo-Ethiopian War\"), after the appeal for international intervention by [Ethiopian Emperor](/wiki/Ethiopian_Emperor \"Ethiopian Emperor\") [Haile Selassie I](/wiki/Haile_Selassie \"Haile Selassie\") at Geneva in 1936 went with no avail, including when calls for economic sanctions against Italy failed. Italy and other nations left the League.[[5]](#cite_note-5)\n\nWhen [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II \"World War II\") broke out in 1939, the League effectively closed down.[[6]](#cite_note-6)\n\n### Declarations by the Allies of World War II (1941\u20131944)\n\nThe first step towards the establishment of the United Nations was the Inter-Allied Conference in London that led to the [Declaration of St James's Palace](/wiki/Declaration_of_St_James%27s_Palace \"Declaration of St James's Palace\") on 12 June 1941.[[7]](#cite_note-7)[[8]](#cite_note-8) By August 1941, American President [Franklin Roosevelt](/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt \"Franklin D. Roosevelt\") and British Prime Minister [Winston Churchill](/wiki/Winston_Churchill \"Winston Churchill\") had drafted the [Atlantic Charter](/wiki/Atlantic_Charter \"Atlantic Charter\"); which defined goals for the post-war world. At the subsequent meeting of the Inter-Allied Council in London on 24 September 1941, the eight [governments in exile of countries under Axis occupation](/wiki/List_of_governments_in_exile_during_World_War_II \"List of governments in exile during World War II\"), together with the [Soviet Union](/wiki/Soviet_Union \"Soviet Union\") and representatives of the [Free French Forces](/wiki/Free_French_Forces \"Free French Forces\"), unanimously adopted adherence to the common principles of policy set forth by Britain and the United States.[[9]](#cite_note-9)[[10]](#cite_note-10)\n\nRoosevelt and Churchill met at the [White House](/wiki/White_House \"White House\") in December 1941 for the [Arcadia Conference](/wiki/Arcadia_Conference \"Arcadia Conference\"). Roosevelt is considered a founder of the UN,[[11]](#cite_note-11)[[12]](#cite_note-12) and coined the term *United Nations* to describe the [Allied countries](/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II \"Allies of World War II\").[[13]](#cite_note-13) Churchill accepted it, noting its use by [Lord Byron](/wiki/Lord_Byron \"Lord Byron\").[[14]](#cite_note-14) The text of the [Declaration by United Nations](/wiki/Declaration_by_United_Nations \"Declaration by United Nations\") was drafted on 29 December 1941, by Roosevelt, Churchill, and [Harry Hopkins](/wiki/Harry_Hopkins \"Harry Hopkins\"). It incorporated Soviet suggestions but included no role for France. One major change from the Atlantic Charter was the addition of a provision for [religious freedom](/wiki/Religious_freedom \"Religious freedom\"), which Stalin approved after Roosevelt insisted.[[15]](#cite_note-15)[[16]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTESherwood1948447\u2013453-16)\n\nRoosevelt's idea of the \"[Four Powers](/wiki/Four_Policemen \"Four Policemen\")\", refers to the four major Allied countries, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and [China](/wiki/Republic_of_China_(1912%E2%80%931949) \"Republic of China (1912\u20131949)\"), emerged in the Declaration by the United Nations.[[17]](#cite_note-sheriff-17) On New Year's Day 1942, Roosevelt, Churchill, the Soviet Union's former Foreign Minister [Maxim Litvinov](/wiki/Maxim_Litvinov \"Maxim Litvinov\"), and the Chinese Premier [T. V. Soong](/wiki/T._V._Soong \"T. V. Soong\") signed the \"[Declaration by United Nations](/wiki/Declaration_by_United_Nations \"Declaration by United Nations\")\",[[18]](#cite_note-18) and the next day the representatives of twenty-two other nations added their signatures. During the war, the United Nations became the official term for the Allies. In order to join, countries had to sign the Declaration and declare war on the [Axis powers](/wiki/Axis_powers \"Axis powers\").[[19]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTESchlesinger2003-19)\n\nThe October 1943 [Moscow Conference](/wiki/Moscow_Conference_(1943) \"Moscow Conference (1943)\") resulted in the [Moscow Declarations](/wiki/Moscow_Declarations \"Moscow Declarations\"), including the [Four Power Declaration on General Security](/wiki/Declaration_of_the_Four_Nations \"Declaration of the Four Nations\"). This declaration was signed by the [Allied Big Four](/wiki/Big_Four_(World_War_II) \"Big Four (World War II)\")\u2014the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and China\u2014and aimed for the creation \"at the earliest possible date of a general international organization\". This was the first public announcement that a new international organization was being contemplated to replace the League of Nations. The [Tehran Conference](/wiki/Tehran_Conference \"Tehran Conference\") followed shortly afterwards at which Roosevelt, Churchill and [Joseph Stalin](/wiki/Joseph_Stalin \"Joseph Stalin\"), the leader of the Soviet Union, met and discussed the idea of a post-war international organization.\n\nThe new international organization was formulated and negotiated amongst the delegations from the [Allied Big Four](/wiki/Big_Four_(World_War_II) \"Big Four (World War II)\") at the [Dumbarton Oaks Conference](/wiki/Dumbarton_Oaks_Conference \"Dumbarton Oaks Conference\") from 21 September to 7 October 1944. They agreed on proposals for the aims, structure and functioning of the new organization.[[20]](#cite_note-Bohlen_1973-20)[[21]](#cite_note-21)[[22]](#cite_note-22) It took the [conference at Yalta](/wiki/Yalta_Conference \"Yalta Conference\") in February 1945, and further negotiations with the Soviet Union, before all the issues were resolved.[[20]](#cite_note-Bohlen_1973-20)\n\n### Founding (1945)\n\nBy 1 March 1945, 21 additional states had signed the Declaration by the United Nations.[[23]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEOsma\u0144czyk20042445-23) After months of planning, the [UN Conference on International Organization](/wiki/United_Nations_Conference_on_International_Organization \"United Nations Conference on International Organization\") opened in [San Francisco](/wiki/San_Francisco \"San Francisco\") on 25 April 1945. It was attended by 50 nations' governments and a number of non-governmental organizations.[[24]](#cite_note-Charter-24)[[25]](#cite_note-UNHistory-25)[[26]](#cite_note-26) The delegations of the Big Four chaired the plenary meetings.[[27]](#cite_note-27) Previously, Churchill had urged Roosevelt to restore France to its status of a major power after the [liberation of Paris](/wiki/Liberation_of_Paris \"Liberation of Paris\") in August 1944. The drafting of the [Charter of the United Nations](/wiki/Charter_of_the_United_Nations \"Charter of the United Nations\") was completed over the following two months, and it was signed on 26 June 1945 by the representatives of the 50 countries.[[28]](#cite_note-28)[[29]](#cite_note-29) The UN officially came into existence on 24 October 1945, upon ratification of the Charter by the five permanent members of the [Security Council](/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council \"United Nations Security Council\"): the United States, the United Kingdom, France, the Soviet Union and [China](/wiki/Republic_of_China_(1912%E2%80%931949) \"Republic of China (1912\u20131949)\") \u2014 and by a majority of the other 46 nations.[[30]](#cite_note-unmilestones1941to1950-30)[[31]](#cite_note-original_draft-31)\n\nThe first meetings of the [General Assembly](/wiki/General_Assembly \"General Assembly\"), with 51 nations represented,[[a]](#cite_note-34) and the Security Council took place in [London](/wiki/London \"London\") beginning in January 1946.[[30]](#cite_note-unmilestones1941to1950-30) Debates began at once, covering topical issues such as the presence of Russian troops in [Iranian Azerbaijan](/wiki/Iranian_Azerbaijan \"Iranian Azerbaijan\") and British forces in [Greece](/wiki/Greece \"Greece\").[[34]](#cite_note-35) British diplomat [Gladwyn Jebb](/wiki/Gladwyn_Jebb \"Gladwyn Jebb\") served as interim secretary-general.\n\nThe General Assembly selected [New York City](/wiki/New_York_City \"New York City\") as the site for the headquarters of the UN. Construction began on 14 September 1948 and the facility was completed on 9 October 1952. The Norwegian Foreign Minister, [Trygve Lie](/wiki/Trygve_Lie \"Trygve Lie\"), was the first elected [UN secretary-general](/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations \"Secretary-General of the United Nations\").[[30]](#cite_note-unmilestones1941to1950-30)\n\n### Cold War (1947\u20131991)\n\nThough the UN's primary mandate was [peacekeeping](/wiki/Peacekeeping \"Peacekeeping\"), the division between the United States and the Soviet Union often paralysed the organization; generally allowing it to intervene only in conflicts distant from the [Cold War](/wiki/Cold_War \"Cold War\").[[35]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeisler199535-36) Two notable exceptions were a Security Council resolution on 7 July 1950 authorizing a [US-led coalition](/wiki/United_Nations_Command \"United Nations Command\") to repel the [North Korean invasion of South Korea](/wiki/Korean_War \"Korean War\"), passed in the absence of the Soviet Union,[[30]](#cite_note-unmilestones1941to1950-30)[[36]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeisler199558\u201359-37) and the signing of the [Korean Armistice Agreement](/wiki/Korean_Armistice_Agreement \"Korean Armistice Agreement\") on 27 July 1953.[[37]](#cite_note-38)\n\nOn 29 November 1947, the General Assembly approved [resolution 181](/wiki/United_Nations_Partition_Plan_for_Palestine \"United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine\"), a proposal to partition [Palestine](/wiki/Mandatory_Palestine \"Mandatory Palestine\") into two states, with Jerusalem placed under a special international regime.[[38]](#cite_note-39) The plan failed[[39]](#cite_note-186-20240719-40) and a [civil war](/wiki/1947%E2%80%931948_civil_war_in_Mandatory_Palestine \"1947\u20131948 civil war in Mandatory Palestine\") broke out in Palestine, that led to the creation of the state of [Israel](/wiki/Israel \"Israel\") afterward.[[40]](#cite_note-41) Two years later, [Ralph Bunche](/wiki/Ralph_Bunche \"Ralph Bunche\"), a UN official, negotiated [an armistice](/wiki/1949_Armistice_Agreements \"1949 Armistice Agreements\") to the [resulting conflict](/wiki/1948_Palestine_war \"1948 Palestine war\"), with the Security Council deciding that \"an armistice shall be established in all sectors of Palestine\".[[39]](#cite_note-186-20240719-40)[[41]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeisler199551\u201354-42) On 7 November 1956, the [first UN peacekeeping force](/wiki/United_Nations_Emergency_Force \"United Nations Emergency Force\") was established to end the [Suez Crisis](/wiki/Suez_Crisis \"Suez Crisis\");[[42]](#cite_note-unmilestones1951to1960-43) however, the UN was unable to intervene against the Soviet Union's simultaneous invasion of [Hungary](/wiki/Hungary \"Hungary\"), following [the country's revolution](/wiki/Hungarian_Revolution_of_1956 \"Hungarian Revolution of 1956\").[[43]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeisler1995114-44)\n\nOn 14 July 1960, the UN established the [United Nations Operation in the Congo](/wiki/United_Nations_Operation_in_the_Congo \"United Nations Operation in the Congo\") (or UNOC), the largest military force of its early decades, to bring order to [Katanga](/wiki/State_of_Katanga \"State of Katanga\"), restoring it to the control of the [Democratic Republic of the Congo](/wiki/Republic_of_the_Congo_(L%C3%A9opoldville) \"Republic of the Congo (L\u00e9opoldville)\") by 11 May 1964.[[44]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeisler1995115\u2013134-45) While travelling to meet rebel leader [Moise Tshombe](/wiki/Moise_Tshombe \"Moise Tshombe\") during the conflict, [Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld](/wiki/Dag_Hammarskj%C3%B6ld \"Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld\"), often named as one of the UN's most effective secretaries-general,[[45]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeisler199576-46)[[46]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKennedy200760-47)[[47]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFasulo200417,_20-48) [died in a plane crash](/wiki/1961_Ndola_United_Nations_DC-6_crash \"1961 Ndola United Nations DC-6 crash\").

Bush\") stated in February 2003\u2014referring to UN uncertainty towards Iraqi provocations under the Saddam Hussein regime\u2014that \"free nations will not allow the UN to fade into history as an ineffective, irrelevant debating society.\"[[228]](#cite_note-231)[[229]](#cite_note-232)[[230]](#cite_note-233)\n\nIn 2020, former American President [Barack Obama](/wiki/Barack_Obama \"Barack Obama\"), in his memoir *[A Promised Land](/wiki/A_Promised_Land \"A Promised Land\")* noted, \"In the middle of the [Cold War](/wiki/Cold_War \"Cold War\"), the chances of reaching any consensus had been slim, which is why the UN had stood idle as [Soviet tanks rolled into Hungary](/wiki/Hungarian_Revolution_of_1956 \"Hungarian Revolution of 1956\") or [U.S. planes dropped napalm on the Vietnamese countryside](/wiki/Vietnam_War \"Vietnam War\"). Even after the Cold War, divisions within the Security Council continued to hamstring the UN's ability to tackle problems. Its member states lacked either the means or the collective will to reconstruct failing states like [Somalia](/wiki/Somalia \"Somalia\"), or prevent an ethnic slaughter in places like Sri Lanka.\"[[231]](#cite_note-234)[[232]](#cite_note-235)\n\nSince its founding, there have been many calls for [reform of the UN](/wiki/Reform_of_the_United_Nations \"Reform of the United Nations\") but little consensus on how to do so. Some want the UN to play a greater or more effective role in world affairs, while others want its role reduced to humanitarian work.\n\n### Representation and structure\n\nCore features of the UN apparatus, such as the [veto](/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_veto_power \"United Nations Security Council veto power\") privileges of some nations in the [Security Council](/wiki/Security_Council \"Security Council\"), are often described as fundamentally undemocratic, contrary to the UN mission, and a main cause of inaction on genocides and [crimes against humanity](/wiki/Crimes_against_humanity \"Crimes against humanity\").[[233]](#cite_note-236)[[234]](#cite_note-237)\n\nJacques Fomerand state that the most enduring divide in views of the UN is \"the North\u2013South split\" between [richer Northern nations and developing Southern nations](/wiki/North%E2%80%93South_divide_in_the_World \"North\u2013South divide in the World\"). Southern nations tend to favour a more empowered UN with a stronger General Assembly, allowing them a greater voice in world affairs, while Northern nations prefer an economically [laissez-faire](/wiki/Laissez-faire \"Laissez-faire\") UN that focuses on transnational threats such as terrorism.[[235]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFomerand2009civ-238)\n\nThere have been numerous calls for the [UN Security Council's membership to be increased](/wiki/Reform_of_the_United_Nations_Security_Council \"Reform of the United Nations Security Council\"), for different ways of electing the UN's secretary-general, and for a [UN Parliamentary Assembly](/wiki/United_Nations_Parliamentary_Assembly \"United Nations Parliamentary Assembly\") (UNPA).[[236]](#cite_note-239)\n\nIn the context of ongoing United Nations reform discussions, Noble World Foundation (NWF) proposes changing the structure of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) by shifting membership and veto power from individual states to regional organizations like the [European Union](/wiki/European_Union \"European Union\"). This proposed shift is in line with the UNSC's existing practice of basing the selection of non-permanent members on regional representation. Shifting to regional organization-based membership in the UNSC aims to reduce deadlock caused by individual state vetoes. A prime example of this issue was observed on 25 February 2022, when Russia used its veto power to block a resolution against its invasion of Ukraine, thereby underscoring a significant weakness in the UNSC's functioning. NWF's proposal is intended to improve the effectiveness and decision-making process within the UNSC.[[237]](#cite_note-240)[[238]](#cite_note-241)\n\nIn response to concerns regarding the pace of progress under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), recent studies have suggested institutional reforms to enhance the integration of ecological concerns in UN decision-making processes.[[239]](#cite_note-242) Scholars affiliated with the Planet Politics Institute and [The Planetary Democrats](/wiki/The_Planetary_Democrats \"The Planetary Democrats\") have proposed the creation of an Earth System Council, modelled after the UNSC, and a Planetary Parliament, alongside the proposed UNPA, to provide formal representation for ecological interests within the UN system.[[240]](#cite_note-243)[[241]](#cite_note-244)\n\n### Exclusion of nations\n\nSee also: [United Nations list of non-self-governing territories](/wiki/United_Nations_list_of_non-self-governing_territories \"United Nations list of non-self-governing territories\") and [List of states with limited recognition](/wiki/List_of_states_with_limited_recognition \"List of states with limited recognition\")\n\nAfter [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II \"World War II\"), the [French Committee of National Liberation](/wiki/French_Committee_of_National_Liberation \"French Committee of National Liberation\") was late to be recognized by the United States as the government of France, and so the country was initially excluded from the conferences that created the new organization. Future French president [Charles de Gaulle](/wiki/Charles_de_Gaulle \"Charles de Gaulle\") criticized the UN, famously calling it a *machin* (contraption), and was not convinced that a [global security](/wiki/Global_security \"Global security\") alliance would help maintain world peace, preferring [direct defence treaties](/wiki/Foreign_relations_of_France \"Foreign relations of France\") between countries.[[242]](#cite_note-245)\n\nFollowing the [Chinese Civil War](/wiki/Chinese_Civil_War \"Chinese Civil War\"), the government of China was disputed between the [Chinese Nationalist Party](/wiki/Kuomintang \"Kuomintang\") and the [Chinese Communist Party](/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Party \"Chinese Communist Party\"). After the foundation of the [People's Republic of China](/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_China \"People's Republic of China\") (PRC) on 1 October 1949, the government of the [Republic of China](/wiki/Republic_of_China \"Republic of China\") (ROC) retreated to the island of Taiwan,[[243]](#cite_note-246) continuing to claim that it was the sole government of China. After the civil war, the United Nations continued recognizing the ROC as the [official government of China](/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_505_(VI) \"United Nations General Assembly Resolution 505 (VI)\"). In 1971, amid growing debate over the representation of the Chinese people on the mainland,[[244]](#cite_note-247) the General Assembly passed [a resolution](/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly_Resolution_2758_(XXVI) \"United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758 (XXVI)\") recognizing the PRC as *\"the only legitimate representatives of China to the United Nations.\"*[[245]](#cite_note-248) Critics[*[who?](/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Words_to_watch#Unsupported_attributions \"Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch\")*] allege that this position reflects a failure of the organization's development goals and guidelines,[[246]](#cite_note-249) and it garnered renewed scrutiny during the [COVID-19 pandemic](/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic \"COVID-19 pandemic\"), when Taiwan was denied membership into the World Health Organization despite its [relatively effective response to the virus](/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Taiwan \"COVID-19 pandemic in Taiwan\").[[247]](#cite_note-250) Support for Taiwan's inclusion in the UN remains challenged by the People's Republic of China, which claims the territories controlled by Taiwan [as their own territory](/wiki/One_China \"One China\").[[248]](#cite_note-251)\n\n### Independence\n\nThroughout the Cold War, both the United States and the Soviet Union repeatedly accused the UN of favouring the other. In 1950, the Soviet Union boycotted the organization in protest to [China's seat at the UN Security Council](/wiki/China_and_the_United_Nations \"China and the United Nations\") being given to the anti-communist [Republic of China](/wiki/Taiwan \"Taiwan\"). Three years later, the Soviets effectively forced the resignation of UN Secretary-General [Trygve Lie](/wiki/Trygve_Lie \"Trygve Lie\") by refusing to acknowledge his administration due to his support of the [Korean War](/wiki/Korean_War \"Korean War\").[[249]](#cite_note-252)\n\nIronically, the United States had simultaneously scrutinized the UN for employing communists and Soviet sympathizers, following a high-profile accusation that [Alger Hiss](/wiki/Alger_Hiss \"Alger Hiss\"), an American who had taken part in the establishment of the UN, had been a Soviet spy. American Senator Joseph McCarthy claimed that the [UN Secretariat](/wiki/United_Nations_Secretariat \"United Nations Secretariat\") under Secretary-General Lie harboured American communists, leading to further pressure that the UN chief resign.[[250]](#cite_note-253) The United States saw nascent opposition to the UN in the 1960s, particularly amongst conservatives, with groups such as the [John Birch Society](/wiki/John_Birch_Society \"John Birch Society\") stating that the organization was an instrument for communism.[[251]](#cite_note-254) Popular opposition to the UN was expressed through bumper stickers and signs with slogans such as \"Get the U.S. out of the U.N. and the U.N. out of the U.S.!\" and \"You can't spell communism without U.N.\"[[252]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeisler199572\u201373,_82-255)\n\n### National sovereignty\n\nIn the United States, there were concerns about supposed threats to national sovereignty, most notably promoted by the [John Birch Society](/wiki/John_Birch_Society \"John Birch Society\"), which mounted a nationwide campaign in opposition to the UN during the 1960s.[[253]](#cite_note-256)[[254]](#cite_note-257)[[255]](#cite_note-258)\n\nBeginning in the 1990s, the same concern appeared with the [American Sovereignty Restoration Act](/wiki/American_Sovereignty_Restoration_Act \"American Sovereignty Restoration Act\"), which has been introduced multiple times in the [United States Congress](/wiki/United_States_Congress \"United States Congress\"). In 1997, an amendment containing the bill received a floor vote, with 54 representatives voting in favour.[[256]](#cite_note-259)[[257]](#cite_note-260) The 2007 version of the bill ([H.R.\u00a01146](https://www.congress.gov/bill/110th-congress/house-bill/1146)) was authored by [U.S. Representative](/wiki/U.S._Representative \"U.S. Representative\") [Ron Paul](/wiki/Ron_Paul \"Ron Paul\"), to effect the United States' withdrawal from the United Nations. It would repeal various laws pertaining to the UN, terminate authorization for funds to be spent on the UN, terminate UN presence on American property, and withdraw diplomatic immunity for UN employees.[[258]](#cite_note-261) It would provide up to two years for the United States to withdraw.[[259]](#cite_note-lamb-262) The *[Yale Law Journal](/wiki/Yale_Law_Journal \"Yale Law Journal\")* cited the Act as proof that \"the United States's complaints against the United Nations have intensified.\"[[260]](#cite_note-263) The most recent iteration, As of 2022[[update]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=United_Nations&action=edit), is H.R.7806, introduced by [Mike D. Rogers](/wiki/Mike_Rogers_(Alabama_politician) \"Mike Rogers (Alabama politician)\").[[261]](#cite_note-264)\n\n### Bias\n\nThe UN's attention to Israel's treatment of Palestinians is considered excessive by Jewish critics, including Israeli diplomat [Dore Gold](/wiki/Dore_Gold \"Dore Gold\"), British scholar [Robert S. Wistrich](/wiki/Robert_S._Wistrich \"Robert S. Wistrich\"), American legal scholar [Alan Dershowitz](/wiki/Alan_Dershowitz \"Alan Dershowitz\"), Australian politician [Mark Dreyfus](/wiki/Mark_Dreyfus \"Mark Dreyfus\"), and the [Anti-Defamation League](/wiki/Anti-Defamation_League \"Anti-Defamation League\").[[262]](#cite_note-265) In September 2015, [Saudi Arabia](/wiki/Saudi_Arabia \"Saudi Arabia\")'s Faisal bin Hassan Trad was elected chair of an advisory committee in the [UN Human Rights Council](/wiki/United_Nations_Human_Rights_Council \"United Nations Human Rights Council\"),[[263]](#cite_note-266) a move criticized by the [UN Watch](/wiki/UN_Watch \"UN Watch\").[[264]](#cite_note-267) The UNHRC has likewise been accused of anti-Israel bias by Ex-President of the United States [George W. Bush](/wiki/George_W._Bush \"George W. Bush\"), who complained that the Council focused too much attention on Israel and not enough on countries such as Cuba, Venezuela, North Korea and Iran.[[265]](#cite_note-268)\nAmerican [state lawmakers](/wiki/State_legislature_(United_States) \"State legislature (United States)\") have proposed legislation to block various UN programs deemed to threaten U.S. sovereignty.[[266]](#cite_note-269) In 2023, [Tennessee](/wiki/Tennessee \"Tennessee\") enacted legislation to block the implementation of programs \"originating in, or traceable to, the United Nations or a subsidiary entity of the United Nations,\" including [Agenda 21](/wiki/Agenda_21 \"Agenda 21\") and [the 2030 Agenda](/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goals \"Sustainable Development Goals\").[[267]](#cite_note-270)[[268]](#cite_note-271) In her confirmation hearing before the Senate panel to be the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, [Elise Stefanik](/wiki/Elise_Stefanik \"Elise Stefanik\"), described the UN's attitude toward Israel as \"anti-semitic\" and affirmed the views of the right-wing Israeli ministers, [Bezalel Smotrich](/wiki/Bezalel_Smotrich \"Bezalel Smotrich\") and [Ben Gvir](/wiki/Itamar_Ben-Gvir \"Itamar Ben-Gvir\"), that Israel has a 'biblical right to the entire West Bank'.[[269]](#cite_note-d827-272)[[270]](#cite_note-273)[[271]](#cite_note-274)[[272]](#cite_note-275)\n\n### Effectiveness\n\nAccording to [international relations](/wiki/International_relations \"International relations\") scholar [Edward Luck](/wiki/Edward_Luck \"Edward Luck\"), the United States has preferred a feeble United Nations in major projects undertaken by the organization to forestall UN interference with, or resistance to, American policies. \"The last thing the U.S. wants is an independent UN throwing its weight around\", Luck said. Similarly, former [US Ambassador to the United Nations](/wiki/US_Ambassador_to_the_United_Nations \"US Ambassador to the United Nations\") [Daniel Patrick Moynihan](/wiki/Daniel_Patrick_Moynihan \"Daniel Patrick Moynihan\") explained that \"The Department of State desired that the United Nations prove utterly ineffective in whatever measures it undertook. The task was given to me, and I carried it forward with not inconsiderable success.\"[[273]](#cite_note-276)\n\nIn 1994, former special representative of the secretary-general of the UN to Somalia [Mohamed Sahnoun](/wiki/Mohamed_Sahnoun \"Mohamed Sahnoun\") published *Somalia: The Missed Opportunities*,[[274]](#cite_note-277) a book in which he analyses the reasons for the failure of the 1992 UN intervention in [Somalia](/wiki/Somalia \"Somalia\"). Sahnoun claims that between the start of the Somali civil war in 1988 and the fall of the [Siad Barre](/wiki/Siad_Barre \"Siad Barre\") regime in January 1991, the UN missed at least three opportunities to prevent major human tragedies. When the UN tried to provide humanitarian assistance, they were totally outperformed by [NGOs](/wiki/NGO \"NGO\"), whose competence and dedication sharply contrasted with the UN's excessive caution and bureaucratic inefficiencies. Sahnoun warned that if radical reform were not undertaken, then the UN would continue to respond to such crises with inept improvisation.[[275]](#cite_note-278)\n\nBeyond specific instances or areas of alleged ineffectiveness, some scholars debate the overall effectiveness of the UN. Adherents to the [realist](/wiki/Realism_(international_relations) \"Realism (international relations)\") school of international relations take a pessimistic position, arguing that the UN is not an effective organization because it is dominated and constrained by great powers. [Liberal](/wiki/Liberalism_(international_relations) \"Liberalism (international relations)\") scholars counter that it is an effective organization because it has proved capable of solving many problems by working around the restrictions imposed by powerful member states. The UN is generally considered by scholars to be more effective in realms such as public health, and humanitarian assistance.[[276]](#cite_note-279) The ineffectiveness of enforcing [territorial integrity](/wiki/Territorial_integrity \"Territorial integrity\") in the 21st century[[277]](#cite_note-280) have led to debate on possible re-emergence of the [right of conquest](/wiki/Right_of_conquest \"Right of conquest\").[[278]](#cite_note-281)\n\n### Inefficiency and corruption\n\nCritics have also accused the UN of bureaucratic inefficiency, waste, and corruption. In 1976, the General Assembly established the [Joint Inspection Unit](/wiki/Joint_Inspection_Unit \"Joint Inspection Unit\") to seek out inefficiencies within the UN system. During the 1990s, the United States withheld dues citing inefficiency and only started repayment on the condition that a major reforms initiative be introduced. In 1994, the [Office of Internal Oversight Services](/wiki/United_Nations_Office_of_Internal_Oversight_Services \"United Nations Office of Internal Oversight Services\") (or the OIOS) was established by the General Assembly to serve as an efficiency watchdog.[[279]](#cite_note-282)\n\nIn 2004, the UN faced accusations that its recently ended [Oil-for-Food Programme](/wiki/Oil-for-Food_Programme \"Oil-for-Food Programme\") \u2014 in which Iraq had been allowed to trade oil for basic needs to relieve the pressure of sanctions \u2014 had suffered from widespread corruption, including billions of dollars of [kickbacks](/wiki/Kickback_(bribery) \"Kickback (bribery)\"). An independent inquiry created by the UN found that many of its officials had been involved in [the scheme](/wiki/Oil-for-Food_Program_Hearings \"Oil-for-Food Program Hearings\"), and raised significant questions about the role of [Kojo Annan](/wiki/Kojo_Annan \"Kojo Annan\"), the son of [Kofi Annan](/wiki/Kofi_Annan \"Kofi Annan\").[[280]](#cite_note-283)\n\n## Model United Nations\n\nMain article: [Model United Nations](/wiki/Model_United_Nations \"Model United Nations\")\n\nThe United Nations has inspired the extracurricular activity Model United Nations (or MUN). MUN is a simulation of United Nations activity based on the UN agenda and following UN procedure. It is usually attended by high school and university students who organize conferences to simulate the various UN committees to discuss important issues of the day.[[281]](#cite_note-284) Today, MUN educates tens of thousands on the activities of the UN around the world. MUN has many famous and notable alumni, such as the former UN Secretary-General [Ban Ki-moon](/wiki/Ban_Ki-moon \"Ban Ki-moon\").[[282]](#cite_note-285)\n\n## Hymn to the United Nations\n\nMain article: [Hymn to the United Nations](/wiki/Hymn_to_the_United_Nations \"Hymn to the United Nations\")\n\nOn the request of then United Nations [Secretary-General](/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations \"Secretary-General of the United Nations\") [U Thant](/wiki/U_Thant \"U Thant\"), a Hymn to the United Nations was performed on the occasion of its 26th anniversary, on 24 October 1971, by [Pau Casals](/wiki/Pau_Casals \"Pau Casals\"), the lyrics to which were penned by the poet [W. H. Auden](/wiki/W._H._Auden \"W. H. Auden\").[[283]](#cite_note-286)\n\nThant first approached Casals, who was a personal friend, looking to create a hymn to peace and hoping for the song to be based on the preamble of the [Charter of the United Nations](/wiki/Charter_of_the_United_Nations \"Charter of the United Nations\"). Thant later commissioned Auden to write the poem after Casals requested one to set to music. Auden completed his work in three days time. The finished work, scored for chorus and orchestra, takes approximately seven minutes to play. However, there were never any plans to adopt the song as the organization's official anthem.\n\n## See also\n\n* [Countries portal](/wiki/Portal:Countries \"Portal:Countries\")\n* [Politics portal](/wiki/Portal:Politics \"Portal:Politics\")\n* [World portal](/wiki/Portal:World \"Portal:World\")\n\n* [International relations](/wiki/International_relations \"International relations\")\n* [List of country groupings](/wiki/List_of_country_groupings \"List of country groupings\")\n* [List of current permanent representatives to the United Nations](/wiki/List_of_current_permanent_representatives_to_the_United_Nations \"List of current permanent representatives to the United Nations\")\n* [List of multilateral free-trade agreements](/wiki/List_of_multilateral_free-trade_agreements \"List of multilateral free-trade agreements\")\n* [PassBlue](/wiki/Passblue \"Passblue\")\n* [Spying on the United Nations](/wiki/Spying_on_the_United_Nations \"Spying on the United Nations\")\n* [UNICEF](/wiki/UNICEF \"UNICEF\")\n* [United Nations Convention Against Torture](/wiki/United_Nations_Convention_Against_Torture \"United Nations Convention Against Torture\")\n* [United Nations in popular culture](/wiki/United_Nations_in_popular_culture \"United Nations in popular culture\")\n* [United Nations Memorial Cemetery](/wiki/United_Nations_Memorial_Cemetery \"United Nations Memorial Cemetery\")\n* [United Nations television film series](/wiki/United_Nations_television_film_series \"United Nations television film series\")\n* [World Summit on the Information Society](/wiki/World_Summit_on_the_Information_Society \"World Summit on the Information Society\")\n\n1. **[^](#cite_ref-34)** Poland had not been represented among the fifty nations at the San Francisco conference due to the reluctance of the Western superpowers to recognize its post-war communist government.
