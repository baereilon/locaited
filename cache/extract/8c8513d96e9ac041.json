But underlining the routine informational session were warnings of caution for those seeking to protest the issues that affect them most closely.\n\n\u201cAs organizers who feel compelled to protest in this day, we have to accept we may be subject to removal,\u201d Jaclyn McJunkin, an immigration-rights organizer and activist, told the group of about 50 people. \u201cIt\u2019s just something that you have to embrace, OK? Because if you don\u2019t, then they win, right?\u201d\n\nFor people living in the US illegally, participating in a public protest has long carried the risk of being identified, detained and processed for deportation. Risk is extended to visa holders, lawful permanent residents and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipients in the country legally \u2014 any interaction with law enforcement could lead to a revocation of their status or other immigration-related consequences.\n\n[NEW YORK, NEW YORK - APRIL 21: For the fifth day, pro-Palestinian students occupy a central lawn on the Columbia University campus, on April 21, 2024 in New York City. Earlier in the week over 100 students were arrested by the police and suspended by the university for demonstrating against the war in Gaza and demanding the University divest from Israel.

During his first term, the president [sicced law enforcement](https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/02/politics/donald-trump-george-floyd-protest-military/index.html) on a peaceful crowd outside the White House protesting George Floyd\u2019s murder in 2020. In the first months of his second term, the president has [expanded his efforts](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/30/politics/trump-punish-opponents/index.html) to stifle dissent and wield his power against institutions that have angered him, including law firms, educational institutions, museums and performing arts centers.\n\nHe said last month he would [try to stop federal funding](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/13/us/protests-legal-illegal-constitution-trump/index.html) for colleges that allowed what he described as \u201cillegal\u201d protests. Trump has not said what in his view makes a protest \u201cillegal.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is something that I\u2019m living every single day,\u201d Cesar Espinosa, a lawful permanent resident who is also the executive director of immigration civil rights organization FIEL Houston, told the Saturday town hall. \u201cI\u2019m in \u2014 not fear \u2014 but I\u2019m constantly thinking about this, and it\u2019s something that has hit close at home.\u201d\n\nEspinosa added: \u201cI have embraced the fact that there could be consequences, but at the end of the day, they could try to take me away, but they\u2019re not going to take away our spirit.\u201d\n\nMore than 700 immigration-related demonstrations [have taken place](https://bridgingdivides.princeton.edu/updates/2025/issue-brief-mapping-rise-immigration-related-demonstrations-early-2025) in the United States in 2025, according to data and analysis from the non-profit Armed Conflict Location & Event Data and the Bridging Divides Initiative at Princeton University, both of which track protest movements.\n\nPeople march through downtown Dallas in protest against the Trump administration\u2019s immigration policies on March 30.\n\nBrandon Bell/Getty Images\n\n## Hundreds demonstrate in Dallas\n\nOne march in Dallas on Sunday drew about 1,200 people, according to estimates from the city\u2019s police department. Protest organizers had hoped for at least 10,000, but said fears about immigration operations might have dampened turnout.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very unique situation with such a hostile political environment that we\u2019re in now. So I wish we had more people, but the fact of the matter is people are scared,\u201d organizer Domingo Garcia told CNN.\n\n[Salvadoran prison guards stand next to alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua and the MS-13 gang recently deported by the U.S. government to be imprisoned in the Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT) prison, as part of an agreement with the Salvadoran government, in Tecoluca, El Salvador, in this handout image obtained March 31, 2025.\n\nSecretaria de Prensa de la Presidencia/Handout/via Reuters\n\nRelated article\nTrump administration concedes Maryland father from El Salvador was mistakenly deported and sent to mega prison](/2025/04/01/politics/maryland-father-mistakenly-deported-el-salvador-prison)\n\nThe crowd, which marched from a cathedral in downtown Dallas to City Hall, was encouraged to wear white and carry American flags as a symbol of unity as organizers called for bipartisan immigration reform.\n\nSome protesters acknowledged anxiety about attending the march but said the moment required them to speak out. Salvador Arthur Cedillo, a 59-year-old Navy veteran who said the Trump administration\u2019s cuts to the Department of Veterans Affairs inspired him to protest, said the president\u2019s crackdown on dissent is inspiring him to \u201cstand up and let my voice be heard.\u201d\n\nAt the front of the march was Democratic Rep. Al Green, who himself is no stranger to dissenting against Trump\u2019s policies. Green, who represents Houston, [was kicked out](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/04/politics/al-green-removed-trump-speech/index.html) of the president\u2019s joint address to Congress last month after interrupting Trump\u2019s speech to criticize his policies. Green was later [censured by the House of Representatives](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/06/politics/al-green-censure-trump-protest-house/index.html) for his interruption.\n\nRep. Al Green marches alongside demonstrators on March 30 in Dallas.\n\nBrandon Bell/Getty Images\n\nThe city is no stranger to large-scale mobilizations for immigration reform. Hundreds of thousands of people participated in a 2006 march to protest proposed legislation that would have strengthened the penalties for illegal immigration.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019santi-immigration rhetoric has also become personal for many protesters, including Marbella Carranza, who has said her 11-year-old daughter, Jocelynn, [died by suicide](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/19/us/jocelynn-rojo-carranza-gainesville-texas-death/index.html#:~:text=Jocelynn%20Rojo%20Carranza%20was%20bullied,Carranza%20told%20CNN%20affiliate%20KUVN.) after being bullied due to her family\u2019s immigration status.\n\nBriefly addressing protesters at the end of the march, Carranza, her voice breaking, told the crowd in Spanish that she\u2019s never marched for a cause before, but said it\u2019s important to fight for immigration reform, especially after \u201ceverything my daughter went through.\u201d\n\n\u201cI only ask the community to continue fighting, to continue united for this cause and that my daughter\u2019s death not be in vain,\u201d Carranza said.\n\ninfo\n\nThe top numbered articles will be viewable to readers when programmed onto a page.
