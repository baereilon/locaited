        "content": "In cities across the United States, gentrification is a bitterly contested issue. _Gentrification_ refers to the process by which previously disinvested urban neighborhoods experience capital investment and the in-migration of relatively well-off individuals (Smith 1998:198), leading to concerns over pricing out or otherwise displacing incumbent residents (Marcuse 1986; Newman and Wyly 2006). Many insist, however, that this process is not _only_ about housing displacement. Activists, [...] Gentrification is not a single process that plays out evenly across social groups; rather, it interacts with existing landscapes of inequality to produce disparate manifestations and impacts. Along with social class, scholars have also long identified racial stratification within gentrifying neighborhoods. Researchers tend to find that residents of color \u2013 particularly those who are Black and Latinx \u2013 often more acutely experience gentrification-related feelings of exclusion, alienation, [...] Gentrification does not always reflect the dynamics of white influx. Sometimes the in-movers are middle-class people of the same general racial background as the incumbent community. These co-ethnic forms of development are sometimes referred to as \u201cBlack gentrification\u201d (Taylor 1992) and \u201c_gente_-fication\u201d (Latinx-led gentrification; see Delgado and Swanson 2021). There are mixed views on the implications of these movements for the local social environment. While some residents may adhere to a",

The need to balance cultural loss and reduced affordability against providing infrastructure improvements is of the utmost importance. This approach often leads to enhanced public services, improved infrastructure, higher-quality schools, increased green space maintenance and a more robust public safety [...] As property values and rents increase, long-time residents\u2014typically lower-income renters and those from communities of color\u2014are pushed out of their neighborhoods, unable to keep up with the rising cost of living.

As wealthier, sometimes more homogeneous groups move in, local businesses, cultural landmarks and community gathering spaces that have served [...] Not only are the pros and cons of gentrification controversial, but even the methods used to assess whether a neighborhood has gentrified are disputable. Various metrics \u2013  such as income levels, housing prices or demographic shifts \u2013 can be used to measure gentrification, with different approaches yielding different conclusions about the extent and impact of these changes (Finio, 2022).
