He appropriated poetry, drawing, and painting, and married text and image, abstraction, figuration, and historical information mixed with contemporary critique. He used social commentary in his paintings as a tool for introspection and for identifying with his experiences in the black community, as well as attacks on power structures and systems of racism.",

One can witness the artist\u2019s process through what Buchhart describes as his \u201cinimitable line \u2026 one that is ready to fight, razor sharp, injured and injuring at the same time; it becomes an existential line between powerlessness and self-empowerment, between human existence and the urgently pressing forces of everyday and institutionalized racism, repression, violence, and death.\u201d",
