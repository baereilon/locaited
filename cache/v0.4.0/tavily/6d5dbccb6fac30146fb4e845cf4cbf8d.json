[...] The Harlem Cultural Festival demonstrates the centrality of Black popular music as both an expression and active part of the Civil Rights and Black Power era. \n\nAdditionally, like other such events, it refuted the racist belief that Black people could not gather without violence, a cornerstone of \u201claw and order\u201d rhetoric that bolstered \u201cWar on Crime\u201d legislation and fears of Black militancy in the late 1960s. [...] Most importantly, it remains a resonant reminder of the importance of musical culture to both understand the present and transform the future. \n\nThe festival began as the brainchild of Tony Lawrence, a St. Kitts-born performer and New York Parks Department employee, in 1967. After two successful smaller festivals, Lawrence expanded in 1969 thanks to corporate sponsorships and the support of New York Mayor John Lindsay, a progressive Republican popular with Black voters.",
