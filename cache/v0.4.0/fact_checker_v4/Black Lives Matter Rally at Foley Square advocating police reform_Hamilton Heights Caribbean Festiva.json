He appropriated poetry, drawing, and painting, and married text and image, abstraction, figuration, and historical information mixed with contemporary critique.

One can witness the artist\u2019s process through what Buchhart describes as his \u201cinimitable line \u2026 one that is ready to fight, razor sharp, injured and injuring at the same time; it becomes an existential line between powerlessness and self-empowerment, between human existence and the urgently pressing forces of everyday and institutionalized racism, repression, violence, and death.\u201d",

[...] Most importantly, it remains a resonant reminder of the importance of musical culture to both understand the present and transform the future. \n\nThe festival began as the brainchild of Tony Lawrence, a St. Kitts-born performer and New York Parks Department employee, in 1967. After two successful smaller festivals, Lawrence expanded in 1969 thanks to corporate sponsorships and the support of New York Mayor John Lindsay, a progressive Republican popular with Black voters.",
